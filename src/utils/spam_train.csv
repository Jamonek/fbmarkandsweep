68851849,1,"Hi, let me introduce you to FM GROUP. A lot of people have been asking me what FM is all about and how it works. Well there is so much to tell about FM so I will just give you a summary about the business and what to do to be a registered member. You can be a patner of FM GROUP whether you are employed or unemployed. It's an avenue to make extra income. So read down and see the reason why you should join FM.??FM Group is a company in Europe that makes perfumes, home fragrance, aftershaves, cosmetics and many other products for the car, laundry, home, men, women and children. So first you see that there is a broad scope.??Secondly our products are of the highest quality. At par with all the top and most popular labels like bvlgari, gucci, lacoste, armani, ck, davidoff etc.??Because our first products were strictly fragrances we have every existing perfume(in composition) in the world. And what more we don't do celebrity endorsement so our products are way less expensive/more affordable.??The FM Group company decided to now use the direct selling method in getting there goods across to there customers...which is where you and I come in as Distributors.

68851620,1,"Hi, let me introduce you to FM GROUP. A lot of people have been asking me what FM is all about and how it works. Well there is so much to tell about FM so I will just give you a summary about the business and what to do to be a registered member. You can be a patner of FM GROUP whether you are employed or unemployed. It's an avenue to make extra income. So read down and see the reason why you should join FM.??FM Group is a company in Europe that makes perfumes, home fragrance, aftershaves, cosmetics and many other products for the car, laundry, home, men, women and children. So first you see that there is a broad scope.??Secondly our products are of the highest quality. At par with all the top and most popular labels like bvlgari, gucci, lacoste, armani, ck, davidoff etc.??Because our first products were strictly fragrances we have every existing perfume(in composition) in the world. And what more we don't do celebrity endorsement so our products are way less expensive/more affordable.??The FM Group company decided to now use the direct selling method in getting there goods across to there customers...which is where you and I come in as Distributors. To join the company and become a distributor they decided to simplify it by making d registration fee very very minimal so that the usual issue of capital is not an excuse as it is with most businesses.??So first we are a retail company. When you get your starter kit and come on board as a distributor you start getting products cheap @ discounted prices and you retail for a profit(most of your pay come from ur profit).??You can stop there or you can continue to the marketing aspect. Let me quickly tell you that the business is viable and moving in our country because their product is a day to day products used in our home, office and personal use. The products practically sell themselves.??Once you join, you get products cheap and retail to get profit. Then secondly, each time you shop FM pays you a commission on products purchased. Now this is not a get rich quick scheme as you buy and have people join you your commissions build steadily to solid figures.??Once others like what you do, love the products and join you to sell and use then you get paid each time they shop, once people under them join FM you get paid each time those people shop as well. In a few months or between 1-2 years of your paying attention you begin to get their company incentives! The big cash, holidays and car incentives. In addition to your steady commissions.??Retail business is great business.??To join you pay in directly into our company accounts then we'll take your teller/deposit slip number and fill your online registration form with your address and other personal details then your starter kit gets delivered to you in 72hours max.??In Nigeria we have FM headquarters in Port Harcourt and a smaller office in Lagos. With new mobile offices in two other locations.??You can pay into any of these accounts. ?Access: 000534****?Sterling: 51183490****?First bank: 201300****?Account name:?Federico Mahora. (Big kit)?Amount: (N15,865)?****(The complete account details will be sent to serious entrepreneurs)??Pls when you pay in let me know so that I'll use your teller number to do your online registration. Pls copy the account numbers somewhere because you'll be using them to order for goods.??The kit content are your work tools. You will be sent in the Big kit 150 perfume sample bottles, 1 big bottle of perfume, 1 business manual, 1 pricelist,1 crested pen, 3 product catalogs of every product FM makes with each price and detailed descriptions of uses.??If you require any more information, visit www.fmgroupng.com or www.nigeria.fmworld.com or reply me with your questions. See you on TOP of FM board.??From?Nwokike F. O. ?#TheTotalEntrepreneur"

17111312,1,"Scholastica, the sister of Saint Benedict, had been consecrated to God from her earliest years. She was accustomed to visiting her brother once a year. He would come down to meet her at a place on the monastery property, not far outside the gate. One day she came as usual and her saintly brother went with some of his disciples; they spent the whole day praising God and talking of sacred things. As night fell they had supper together. Their spiritual conversation went on and the hour grew late. The holy nun said to her brother, “Please do not leave me tonight; let us go on until morning talking about the delights of the spiritual life.” “Sister,” he replied, “What are you saying? I simply cannot stay outside my cell.” When she heard her brother refuse her request, the holy woman joined her hands on the table, laid her head on them and began to pray. As she raised her head from the table, there were such brilliant flashes of lightning, such great peals of thunder and such a heavy downpour of rain that neither Benedict nor his brethren could stir across the threshold of the place where they had been seated. Sadly, he began to complain. “May God forgive you, sister. What have you done?” “Well, she answered, “I asked you and you would not listen; so I asked my God and he did listen. So now go off, if you can, leave me and return to your monastery.” So it came about that they stayed awake the whole night, engrossed in their conversation about the spiritual life. Three days later, Benedict was in his cell. Looking up to the sky, he saw his sister’s soul leave her body in the form of a dove, and fly up to the secret places of heaven. Rejoicing in her great glory, he thanked almighty God with hymns and words of praise. He then sent his brethren to bring her body to the monastery and lay it in the tomb he had prepared for himself"
17111311,1,"Video Success Is Like Success of the ‘Old Days:’ It’s Not What You Know, It’s Who You Know??Listen to this Post??Video Success  Is Like Success of the ‘Old Days:’ It’s Not What You Know, It’s Who You Know??Chris Atkinson    |   Aug 12, 2013 @ 2:01pm   |??I recently wrote a post concerning a widely-held belief that YouTube  simply “pushes” the channels that are already popular.  My conclusions  in that post were that YouTube does indeed do this–but only when you have shown  that you can help yourself.  In the middle of that, I talked about being  able to talk to influencers, or “gatekeepers,” at blogs, websites, and social  media.??Even though one commenter on that post told me that this sounded like a bunch  of bs, it’s the prevailing theme of most video  success.  You simply can’t get a video to go viral without  it.  Even if the goal is not necessarily “virality,” the entire theme is to  get your video in front of people who would be interested in watching it.   So if you make furniture videos, find those who write about and discuss  furniture.  Shake hands over the internet.??If you look at any source entitled, “How to make a video go viral,” this is  the main way to get people watching…if your content is good.  Recently at  the ReelSEO Video Marketing Summit, almost every  panel mentioned this in some way, even though it was never explicitly pointed  out.  You must develop relationships with people who can get your videos  some kind of press.??I was forwarded such a “how videos go viral” article earlier today.  It  takes three case studies: “Ryan Gosling won’t eat his cereal,” the Chris  Hadfield “Space Oddity,” sensation, and the video that seems to never take a  break from our consciousness, “Dove Real Beauty Sketches.”  It delves into  the sharing phenomenon really well: it even has 30-second YouTube videos mapping  out the activity.??Ryan Gosling Won’t Eat His Cereal:??And the video showing how it went viral:??Obviously, Ryan McHenry tapped into something silly when he made these  vines.  There are 17 in total as of this writing.  It’s as simple as  it gets: take a Gosling clip, insert a spoon of cereal, and have his action in  the clip make it look like he sees that cereal and doesn’t want it.  But  you know, I bet if I searched all over the internet, I’d find other kinds of  hilarious videos in the same vein that didn’t go viral.  Why?  Because  those people never struck up the relationships they needed to get that video  shared.  They think great content will eventually be seen, no matter what.??Even though we live in an entirely different age from say, ten, twenty years  ago, the old maxim, “It’s not what you know, it’s who you know,” still  stands.  We just don’t have to get out of our house to do it anymore,  although that would certainly help if you live in the neighborhood of a top  influencer.  We like to think that there is a certain fairness to the  world: people will recognize me for my abilities and my hard work will pay  off.  What is it about applying to a tough university that you always hear:  all the applicants have essentially the same qualities and the same  extra-curriculars, but who gets in?  What makes you memorable?  Why  should anyone take a chance on you?  Take a look at this article in Forbes.  Isn’t that  basically saying the same thing: those who get help are the ones who can help  themselves???In the video world, it’s not enough to make great content.  You can know  every trick in the book to make awesome videos, but they’ll never be seen until  you take the initiative to position them in front of relevant people who have  respectable followings.??The way you do that is much like developing any other relationship in the  world.   The YouTube Creator Playbook has a whole chapter dedicated to this.   And I wrote  about it a couple of years ago.  The article not only covers the  Playbook, but a classic Freddie Wong post where he tells the story about sending a  “Price Is Right”-themed video to a Price Is Right blog.  All of that is a  blueprint in how to get a blog’s attention.  Because it’s one  thing to tell you that you need to do something.  It’s another to tell you  how.  That post tells anyone who wants to do the work how to get the  attention of important influencers from blogs, social media, and other  websites–but be prepared for quite a bit of rejection in the process,  too.??Source:  Video Success Isn’t What You Know, It’s WHO You Know http://ift.tt/1jpr0EF ©ReelSEO.com, All Rights Reserved Follow us: @ReelSEO on Twitter | ReelSEO on Facebook?? ??http://ift.tt/14qhjZS??www.comprimido.pt??http://ift.tt/1dhAxcE??The post Video Success Is Like Success of the ‘Old Days:’ It’s Not What You Know, It’s Who You Know appeared first on Web Video Marketing Portugal."
17111271,1,"I'm very excited to report that our classmate Robin (Rosenblate) Berman, MD, will be publishing her first book on April 29. ??""Permission to Parent"" (available for pre-order on Amazon.com -- sorry couldn't resist) is a heartfelt, enlightening, funny and heartwarming collection of insights and stories to help you develop a stronger, closer, healthier relationship with your children -- a relationship that Robin contends is much more important than any engineering you might do to get your child into the ""right"" kindergarten, college or sports club.??I had the pleasure of working on the book with Robin, even though until 2012, we hadn't spoken in more than a dozen years, and it had been even longer since we'd seen each other. We reconnected after I moved to LA, having spent five years tending my parents in their last years. Robin was well-established here, with a psychiatric practice, an associate professorship, the most lovely husband and three wonderful children.??We met for lunch, and it was like we were back in the Chapin House living room. Robin told me about her book and said she needed an editor. A 15-year journalist, I was looking to ease into freelance editing. And just like that, we dove into Robin’s dream project, a book based on her experiences as a mom, a psychiatrist and a parenting group leader.??I can't tell you how often, when we worked through a rough section or crafted a passage of which we were particularly proud, we high-fived and said ""Smith women!"" The rhythm was easy and the work a pleasure. I'm proud to have played a small part in making Robin's dream book come to fruition. And I'm proud of the way Smith taught us that smart women working together can do anything. I hope you check out the book."

17111106,1,"Today is the feast of St. Scholastica (480-542?) ??Twins often share the same interests and ideas with an equal intensity. Therefore, it is no surprise that Scholastica and her twin brother, Benedict (July 11), established religious communities within a few miles from each other. ??Born in 480 of wealthy parents, Scholastica and Benedict were brought up together until he left central Italy for Rome to continue his studies. ??Little is known of Scholastica’s early life. She founded a religious community for women near Monte Cassino at Plombariola, five miles from where her brother governed a monastery. ??The twins visited each other once a year in a farmhouse because Scholastica was not permitted inside the monastery. They spent these times discussing spiritual matters. ??According to the Dialogues of St. Gregory the Great, the brother and sister spent their last day together in prayer and conversation. Scholastica sensed her death was close at hand and she begged Benedict to stay with her until the next day. ??He refused her request because he did not want to spend a night outside the monastery, thus breaking his own Rule. Scholastica asked God to let her brother remain and a severe thunderstorm broke out, preventing Benedict and his monks from returning to the abbey. ??Benedict cried out, “God forgive you, Sister. What have you done?” Scholastica replied, “I asked a favor of you and you refused. I asked it of God and he granted it.” ??Brother and sister parted the next morning after their long discussion. Three days later, Benedict was praying in his monastery and saw the soul of his sister rising heavenward in the form of a white dove. Benedict then announced the death of his sister to the monks and later buried her in the tomb he had prepared for himself."

17110466,1,"Just read this. If we can only learn from Solomon.           ""You are as beautiful as Tirzah, my darling, as lovely as Jerusalem, as majestic as troops with banners. Turn your eyes from me; they overwhelm me. Your hair is like a flock of goats descending from Gilead. Your teeth are like a flock of sheep coming up from the washing. Each has its twin, not one of them is missing. Your temples behind your veil are like the halves of a pomegranate. Sixty queens there may be, and eighty concubines, and virgins beyond number; but my dove, my perfect one, is unique, the only daughter of her mother, the favorite of the one who bore her. The young women saw her and called her blessed; the queens and concubines praised her."" (Song of Solomon 6:4-9). No further comments."

17110231,1,"Kambal chapter 4??Hindi ako nakakibo sa tanong ni Claire. Nahalata nya ito. “Kuya, sa tingin mo kakayanin ko yung sa pwet? I wanna try it. Tignan mo, enjoy yung nasa movie.” “Nasubukan ko na iyan dati. Nag-experiment kami ng ex ko. Sa una medyo masakit. Pero siguro kung relaxed ka, sasarap din yan. Pero you’re too young to try that,” pakipot ko pang tugon. Pilit kong tinatago ang kasabikan ko sa ideya na titirahin ko ang bata kong pinsan sa pwet. ”I’m relaxed. Try natin kuya,pretty please. Curious lang talaga ako,” pa-cute na pagmamakaawa ni Claire. Kagyat nyang pinaghahalikan ang utong ko. Muli din nyang pinagapang ang malambot na kamay sa titi ko. Bumaba ang ulo nya. Shit, ilang saglit na naman ay isusubo na naman nya ang titi ko. Di na nga sya naghintay; hinalikan nya ang ulo at dali dali nya akong binlow job. Marunong na ang bata na gamitin ang laway upang lalo pang dumulas ang pagsubo sa akin. Kinapa ko mula sa likod nya ang kanyang puke. Basang basa pa din ito. ”Claire, ipatong mo ang puke mo sa mukha ko. 69 tayo,” utos ko. Nakapaghugas na pala ng puke si Claire. Wala nang bakas ng tamod ko na aking pinaputok kanila lang. Ang naiwan ay ang mabangong amoy ng kanyang sariwang puke. Amoy Dove soap. Pinunterya ko ang kanyang kuntil. Dinilaan ko muna ito upang magdulot ng kiliti sa bata. Napansin kong kusa nyang iginigiling ang balakang. Binigyan ko ng isang madiin na pagsipsip ang kanyang clit. ”Oh shit, oh shit. Ang saraaapp…” sigaw ng bata kong pinsan. Habang nilalaro ng dila ko ang puke ni Claire, nakita ko nang malapitan ang butas ng kanyang pwet. Napakaputi ng kutis at pinkish ang butas nito. Saradong sarado pa. Hindi ko alam kung paano ko pagkakasyahin ang titi ko sa makipot nyang tumbong. Bahala na. ”Claire, try ko lang ka.” Tinigil ko muna ang pagdila sa puke nya. Pinatalim ko ang dila ko at dinilaan ko ang butas ng kanyang pwet. Napakapit nang mahigpit si Claire sa titi ko. ”Ummm, ang sarap kuya…” May sampung minuto kong nilaro ng dila ang kanyang pwet, sabay masahe sa kanyang tinggel. Hindi na kinaya ni Claire na isubo ako ang titi ko sa sarap na nadarama. Binabate na lang nya ako. Di naglaon ay pinakawalan ni Claire ang isang masarap na panginginig ng katawan. Ramdam ko ang pag-agos ng masaganang hima mula sa puke nito. Hinayaan ko munang humiga si Claire upang lasapin ang sarap ng kanyang orgasmo. Tumayo ako, na may hinahanap sa kanyang mga toiletries. Agad kong nakita ang hinahanap ko. ”Natuyo pa ang labi mo kuya? Bakit mo kinuha yang petroleum jelly ko?” Natawa ako: ”May ibang ...» Next part"
17110230,1,"Today, February 10th, is the feast day of St. Scholastica, virgin. Scholastica and her twin brother, St. Benedict, established religious communities within a few miles from each other. ?Born in 480 of wealthy parents, Scholastica and Benedict were brought up together until he left central Italy for Rome to continue his studies. ??Little is known of Scholastica’s early life. She founded a religious community for women near Monte Cassino at Plombariola, five miles from where her brother governed a monastery. ??The twins visited each other once a year in a farmhouse because Scholastica was not permitted inside the monastery. They spent these times discussing spiritual matters. ??According to the Dialogues of St. Gregory the Great, the brother and sister spent their last day together in prayer and conversation. Scholastica sensed her death was close at hand and she begged Benedict to stay with her until the next day. ??He refused her request because he did not want to spend a night outside the monastery, thus breaking his own Rule. Scholastica asked God to let her brother remain and a severe thunderstorm broke out, preventing Benedict and his monks from returning to the abbey. ??Benedict cried out, “God forgive you, Sister. What have you done?” Scholastica replied, “I asked a favor of you and you refused. I asked it of God and he granted it.” ??Brother and sister parted the next morning after their long discussion. Three days later, Benedict was praying in his monastery and saw the soul of his sister rising heavenward in the form of a white dove.

You received without paying; give without pay. ?9 Acquire no gold or silver or copper for your belts, ?10 no bag for your journey, or two tunics or sandals or a staff, for the laborer deserves his food. ?11 And whatever town or village you enter, find out who is worthy in it and stay there until you depart. ?12 As you enter the house, greet it. ?13 And if the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it, but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you. ?14 And if anyone will not receive you or listen to your words, shake off the dust from your feet when you leave that house or town. ?15 Truly, I say to you, it will be more bearable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah than for that town. ?16 Behold, I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves, so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves. ?17 Beware of men, for they will deliver you over to courts and flog you in their synagogues, ?18 and you will be dragged before governors and kings for my sake, to bear witness before them and the Gentiles. ?19 When they deliver you over, do not be anxious how you are to speak or what you are to say, for what you are to say will be given to you in that hour. ?20 For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you."""

17109946,1,"Chronological Bible verses day 289??John 2-4 (King James Version)?John 2-4??2 And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:??2 And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.??3 And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.??4 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.??5 His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.??6 And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.??7 Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.??8 And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it.??9 When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,??10 And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now.??11 This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.??12 After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.??13 And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.??14 And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:??15 And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;??16 And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.??17 And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.??18 Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things???19 Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.??20 Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days???21 But he spake of the temple of his body.??22 When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.??23 Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.??24 But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men,??25 And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.??3 There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:??2 The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.??3 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.??4 Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born???5 Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.??6 That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.??7 Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.??8 The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.??9 Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be???10 Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things???11 Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.??12 If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things???13 And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.??14 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:??15 That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.??16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.??17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.??18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.??19 And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.??20 For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.??21 But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.??22 After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.??23 And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.??24 For John was not yet cast into prison.??25 Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying.??26 And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.??27 John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.??28 Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.??29 He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.??30 He must increase, but I must decrease.??31 He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.??32 And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.??33 He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.??34 For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.??35 The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.??36 He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him. When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,??2 (Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)??3 He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.??4 And he must needs go through Samaria.??5 Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.??6 Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour.??7 There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.??8 (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)??9 Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.??10 Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.??11 The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water???12 Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle???13 Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:??14 But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.??15 The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.??16 Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.??17 The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:??18 For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.??19 The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.??20 Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.??21 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.??22 Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.??23 But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.??24 God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.??25 The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.??26 Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.??27 And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her???28 The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,??29 Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ???30 Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.??31 In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.??32 But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.??33 Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat???34 Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.??35 Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.??36 And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.??37 And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.??38 I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.??39 And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.??40 So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.??41 And many more believed because of his own word;??42 And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.??43 Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.??44 For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.??45 Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.??46 So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.??47 When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.??48 Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.??49 The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.??50 Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.??51 And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth.??52 Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.??53 So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.??54 This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.??King James Version (KJV)"

17109169,1,"MEDITATION is the act of calling to mind, some supposition,pondering upon it, and correlating it to one's own life. Meditation by GOD'S people is a reverent act of worship.Through it, they commune with GOD and are thereby renewed spiritually .A wicked man meditates upon violence(prov 24:2). The meditation of a righteous person contemplates  GOD or HIS great spiritual truths (Ps 63:6;77:12; 119:15,23 27,48 ,78,97,148;143:5). A believer hopes to please GOD by meditation(19:14). The Hebrew words for meditation primarily were derived from two separate roots. The first (HAGAH) literarily means ""to utter in a low sound"" .The word is used to denote the growling of a Lion(Isaiah 31:4) or the cooing of a dove (Is 34:14). Therefore it has been suggested that in ancient Hebrew meditation,scripture was recited in a low murmur. The second root word (SIACH) has the basic meaning of"" to be occupied with"" or ""concerned about"" .  Thus meditaton is the repetitious going over of a matter in one's mind because it is the chief concern of life. The constant recollection of GOD'S past deeds by the hearing of scripture and repetition of thought , produce confidence in GOD(ps 63:6-8;104:34;119:15,23,48,78,97,99,148;143:5). In clear terms MEDITATION is the thoughtful consideration of scriptures. It is the conscious evaluation of scriptures in the mind .To meditate means to reflect upon ,to consider deeply ,to resolve,and assimilate in the mind, the word of GOD ; to allow the word of GOD take root in the deepest part of your spirit.

17109126,1,"I loved you first: but afterwards your love ?    Outsoaring mine, sang such a loftier song ?As drowned the friendly cooings of my dove. ?    Which owes the other most? my love was long, ?    And yours one moment seemed to wax more strong; ?I loved and guessed at you, you construed me ?And loved me for what might or might not be – ?    Nay, weights and measures do us both a wrong. ?For verily love knows not ‘mine’ or ‘thine;’ ?    With separate ‘I’ and ‘thou’ free love has done, ?         For one is both and both are one in love: ?Rich love knows nought of ‘thine that is not mine;’ ?

17109125,1,"St. Scholastica?St. Scholastica, like her brother, dedicated herself to God from early youth. Information on the virgin Scholastica is very scanty. In his Second Book of Dialogues (Ch. 33 and 34) Pope St. Gregory has described for us the last meeting between brother and sister:??His sister Scholastica, who had been consecrated to God in early childhood, used to visit with him once a year. On these occasions he would go to meet her in a house belonging to the monastery a short distance from the entrance. For this particular visit he joined her there with a few of his disciples and they spent the whole day singing God's praises and conversing about the spiritual life.??When darkness was setting in they took their meal together and continued their conversation at table until it was quite late. Then the holy nun said to him, 'Please do not leave me tonight, brother. Let us keep on talking about the joys of heaven till morning.' 'What are you saying, sister?' he replied. 'You know that I cannot stay away from the monastery.' The sky was so clear at the time, there was not a cloud in sight.??At her brother's refusal Scholastica folded her hands on the table and rested her head upon them in earnest prayer. When she looked up again, there was a sudden burst of lightning and thunder accompanied by such a downpour that Benedict and his companions were unable to set foot outside the door. By shedding a flood of tears while she prayed, this holy nun had darkened the cloudless sky with a heavy rain. The storm began as soon as her prayer was over. In fact, the two coincided so closely that the thunder was already resounding as she raised her head from the table. The very instant she ended her prayer the rain poured down.??Realizing that he could not return to the abbey in this terrible storm, Benedict complained bitterly. 'God forgive you, sister!' he said. 'What have you done?' Scholastica simply answered, 'When I appealed to you, you would not listen to me. So I turned to my God and He heard my prayer. Leave now if you can. Leave me here and go back to your monastery.'??This, of course, he could not do. He had no choice now but to stay, in spite of his unwillingness. They spent the entire night together and both of them derived great profit from the holy thoughts they exchanged about the interior life. The next morning Scholastica returned to her convent and Benedict to his monastery.??Three days later as he stood in his room looking up toward the sky, he beheld his sister's soul leaving her body and entering the heavenly court in the form of a dove. Overjoyed at her eternal glory, he gave thanks to God in hymns of praise. Then, after informing his brethren of her death, he sent some of them to bring her body to the abbey and bury it in the tomb he had prepared for himself. The bodies of these two were now to share a common resting place, just as in life their souls had always been one in God.""??Her tomb is at Monte Cassino. ??— Excerpted from The Church's Year of Grace, Pius Parsch??Patron: Against rain; convulsive children; nuns; storms. ??Symbols: Nun with crozier and crucifix; nun with dove flying from her mouth.??Things to Do:??•Tell your children about the ""holy twins"": St. Scholastica and the tender love she had for her brother St. Benedict. Ask them how they can help one another to become saints.??•Make an altar hanging or window transparency in the shape of a dove to honor St. Scholastica.??•If you are traveling to Italy try to visit St. Benedict's Abbey of Monte Cassino. Here is a YouTube video with more pictures. If not, make a virtual visit.??•Learn how to prayerfully read Sacred Scripture in this article, Lectio Divina: Daily Information for a New Life by Fr.

Officers and Investigators dove into the case head first to identify who this child was, and to put together the puzzle pieces to answer a very big question, ""who would do this?""??Ultimately, she was identified as Ashley Elizabeth Ouellette, a 15 year old from Saco. Ashley lived with both her parents and a younger sister. She had a lot of friends, and she was a student at Thornton Academy.??Days passed and the investigation continued. Ashley had been at a party the previous night and ended up at a home in Saco of two of her friends, Steve and Dan Sanborn. The Sanborn's mother had made up the couch for Ashley to sleep on, and that is the last time anyone admits to seeing Ashley alive.??Very early the next morning a motorist came across Ashley's body laid in the middle of the roadway. And so began the many years of heartache, disappointment, and unanswered questions for Ashley's family, friends, and case investigators.??Please join us today in remember a life lost too soon.

17108960,1,"Daylight!  It just sort of happened.  I was hoping to see the sunrise, but, alas, the ocean is spewing forth clouds...big, boring, rather blah clouds.  Clearly the sun is somewhere behind them, because suddenly all is white light.  The ocean's quite lovely, a sort of light gray blue with a fine white line along the horizon and a slightly gray tinted glow above that before a dark strip of cloud.  And over the harbor, there's a little break in a very dark patch where a narrow strip of very pale pink light illuminates several portentous cranes that match exactly the gray of the huge strip of cloud above.  Every dawn has its day, even if they aren't all spectacular.  Really missing the gorgeous Venus in the mornings!  Talk about '...like a diamond in the sky...!'  There is a little gray morning dove sitting on a phone wire.  Certainly a gray sort of morning.  But there is some blue way up there.  I may get blinded by the light yet this morning.  Although I've been enjoying the cloud covers in the morning, saves me getting irritated by these stupid blinds."

Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.??22 Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself???23 He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.??24 And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.??25 And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet???26 John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;??27 He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.??28 These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.??29 The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.??30 This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.??31 And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.??32 And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.??33 And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.??34 And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.??35 Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;??36 And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!??37 And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.??38 Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou???39 He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.??40 One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.??41 He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.??42 And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.??43 The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me.??44 Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.??45 Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.??46 And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.??47 Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!??48 Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.??49 Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.??50 Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.??51 And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man."

17108643,1,"WOW!!  Awesome how Plexus was  Heather's answer with her fibromyalgia and other health issues!!!  Is it your answer too???  Why not try Plexus for 60 days.. you have nothing to lose as they have a 60 day money back guarantee!! Message me to find out more!!!!??Heather says - ---  Today makes 7 wks. Since I've started taking Plexus! At the end of September 2012, my body was debilitated to the point that I could no longer be relied upon to show up to work on a daily basis. As a matter of fact, my then roommate was going to work with me and doing my job for me while I laid on a couch with my heating pad and taking about 12 lortabs to barely make it through the day! I was working for two different companies providing care for people who were in my shape! Sept. 27th I had to quit! This ""thing"" had robbed me of my job and had begun to rob me of my life as a whole! Quickly, I dove into a cycle of chronic pain, debilitation, and depression! I'm a single mom of two amazing people, my son 19, and my daughter 6! My son has been thrown into the caregiver position. I was not even able to drive myself! And being a parent from my bed was overwhelming to me! I did not and do not want to raise my child from my bed and shoving narcotics down my throat until they shut down my organs and I die! I was loss with no hope, no light at the end of the tunnel for me! I really thought that if this was what my kids would have to see from me from here on out, then I'm not doing it to them! I'm not going to have my kids thinking its ok to live off narcotics and lay up in bed, plus be responsible for taking care of me! That's a hard pill to swallow! I thought about suicide on a regular basis, especially after I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia and learned there is no cure. I even prayed that it was cancer instead. At least that way I had a chance to overcome/survive it or just die! I even thought about how people do move on after someone dies and eventually my family would move on. I know that sounds very wrong and awful and I no longer think those thoughts! But let me tell you, when your body is in constant chronic pain without relief, until you've been there, please don't judge me! Think about being in hard labor and how women behave! Now picture her being in hard labor without ceasing for months on end...catching my drift here? So my mom's best friend started taking Plexus and shared the info with her and then my mom called me! I knew about Plexus for a few months before I started taking it. I didn't have any money because I had stopped working! I had to get on food stamps and eventually my doctor had to sign papers for me to get cash assistance! Is that embarrassing? Yes, it is! But I really have no one to depend on completely, but me! The cash assistance isn't much! $220 a month to be exact! How was I going to order Plexus when I couldn't barely pay my bills?! Thank God, I don't pay rent! On the second month I recieved my cash assistance I took the chance and ordered what they suggested based upon my needs! I didn't have a choice, at this point, I wasn't going to make it through another month anyway so it was either die now or trust God to provide a way to cover my bills and order this stuff that people are getting great results on and live again! Well, by reading this, you know what I chose! I'm Here today! I'm also not completely cured but I am on the road to recovery! I went from being on Fentanyl patch 50mcg to the lowest dose of morphine (with no withdrawals), I've been able to get off my kolonpin for anxiety, and stop taking my allergy medication! I've also lost 13lbs and have kept it off! I still have a road ahead of me and a battle to fight! I recently found out that I tested positive for an auto immune disease which through further testing they will he able to determine which one I have. Also, I have suffered from servers allergies in which I'm supposed to carry an epi pen! I an allergic to basically everything and almost all the foods I've been tested for! Suffering with that you're whole life is more than most can handle and that in itself has been devestating to me my whole life! I have suffered with hypoglycemia since childhood and guess what? It's GONE! And on top of all of that, chronic fatigue! Yuck! But, even the nights I don't sleep well, I still feel good and energetic now thanks to my Plexus! And mind you, I've probably had this auto immune disease for a long time, but I just asked to be tested! That's right, I asked, they didn't just figure it out for me! Now, even on my bad days, which are fewer and further between, I still feel good mentally because I know between God, me, and Plexus, we've got this! When this all got to much for me to bare and I gave it to God, he gave me an answer! You sceptics of GOD out there probably are thinking, why doesn't he just heal you then? I know why, because he knows me and I know me! In many ways I had given up on life. I was a functioning person going to work, church, taking care of my kids, etc. But inside I was almost dead! I have recently lost my daddy, and on top of that, as far as men go, I felt when it came down to it, I always just had me...and I was tired and lonely. Me and God both needed to see me fight for myself and that's what I'm doing! I'm in the battle for my life as a whole and I lay myself wide open here for judgement and embarrassment! But, if I can touch just one person by my testimony, then it is way worth it! I can't rave enough about Plexus and what it continues to do for me! I will say it literally has saved my life on many levels! I see light at the end of my tunnel and I expect a full recovery from all that ails me! ? P.S. I'm also making money again and working my schedule, not Someone else's and that feels great!?? This is my 4 month update: my pain medicine intake is cut in half from where I started. My anxiety medication is used as needed instead of twice a day! My allergy medicine is used as needed and I did allergy testing yesterday and all my food allergies are gone, which I was allergic to corn, wheat, soy, potato, and pinto beans, but no more! My fingernails are grown out and the only time that has happened was when I was pregnant! I have maintained my weight loss and still eat whatever I want! My energy level is great! I've gained my ability to drive again and hold my 9 month old nephew who I couldn't hold when he was newborn! There are just so many little things that are probably insignificant to others that mean the world to me! I basically take the whole system excluding the accelerator. My main concern at this point is to continue to beat my fibromyalgia, Rheumatoid Arthritis, and other health issues that have debilitated me, and I can honestly say that the Plexus system as a whole has given my life back! Not only physically and mentally, but I am now on my way to financial freedom and that is a wonderful feeling to have! Not to mention I'm sitting here right now at 1:00 in the afternoon having a lazy day because I work for myself and I set my own hours! Love love love my Plexus!!<br /><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10203418129999630&set=gm.1421504864756165&type=1&relevant_count=1""></a><br />"

17107702,1,"Scholastica, the sister of Saint Benedict, had been consecrated to God from her earliest years. She was accustomed to visiting her brother once a year. He would come down to meet her at a place on the monastery property, not far outside the gate. ??One day she came as usual and her saintly brother went with some of his disciples; they spent the whole day praising God and talking of sacred things. As night fell they had supper together. ??Their spiritual conversation went on and the hour grew late. The holy nun said to her brother, ""Please do not leave me tonight; let us go on until morning talking about the delights of the spiritual life."" ??""Sister,"" he replied, ""What are you saying? I simply cannot stay outside my cell."" ??When she heard her brother refuse her request, the holy woman joined her hands on the table, laid her head on them and began to pray. As she raised her head from the table, there were such brilliant flashes of lightning, such great peals of thunder and such a heavy downpour of rain that neither Benedict nor his brethren could stir across the threshold of the place where they had been seated. Sadly, he began to complain. ??""May God forgive you, sister. What have you done?"" ??""Well, she answered, ""I asked you and you would not listen; so I asked my God and he did listen. So now go off, if you can, leave me and return to your monastery."" ??So it came about that they stayed awake the whole night, engrossed in their conversation about the spiritual life. ??Three days later, Benedict was in his cell. Looking up to the sky, he saw his sister's soul leave her body in the form of a dove, and fly up to the secret places of heaven. Rejoicing in her great glory, he thanked almighty God with hymns and words of praise. He then sent his brethren to bring her body to the monastery and lay it in the tomb he had prepared for himself. ??from Dialogues by Pope Saint Gregory the Great"

17107621,1,"I-500 Recap.?Gerry -110 -  Dove a ski into deep snow and did a bumper check through his windshield and before the second gas stop broke a ski and leaf spring....but rode that bronco to a 1st place championship for vintage legends. (and 5th in vintage).  Winner of the Mattison Cup and Arctic Insider Contingency Cash of $2.37 (which as not yet been collected)?Dale - 357 -  repeating last year, Dale enjoys replacing engines the day before the big race.   This year he decided he was tough enough to take on a bridge and added some new cooling vents down the side of this belly pan and tore up his exhaust....but we sure could hear him coming as he finished in 5th place for vintage legends. ?Karl -007 - must have been driving on the edge as he crashed 3 times though the 170 plus mile race.  On the first crash he took out his throttle lever and nephew Jake who was just about to pass him.  Jake and Karl fought back and forth pushing each other for the first leg of the race.   Karl's second off was just a time delay and loss of a couple positions.  But the third off was a crowd pleaser that took the windshield and ripped the whole leg of his snow pants....a bit drafty in the well below zero temps....use 1301 for duct tape.  007 finished in 10th place none too soon as he was completely spent.?Jake -747 -After fighting it out with uncle Karl, Jake left him in the dust.  only to come up to a huge valley where he had to go off trail to get around a stuck racer....almost made it but his ski caught an edge, turned him into the other sled, ripped the hood right off and got stuck too.   Karl caught up and could see the trouble, but could not help from the other side.  Jake teamed up with other racer and they got back in the race.  Jake went on to finish in 12th.  Impressive for his first 500!!!?Jim - 139 - rocketed off the line and after watching the video was simply blowing by the competition.  However, mechanical failure took him out of the race on the Thief River.?Mike -  Like his dad, was ripping up the snow and was one of the team that was expected to push Gerry and his Dad to their limits, but also ended his race on the Thief River with mechanical failure.?Pete - 442 - Was the winner of the Piston Cup (not the award he was shooting for) as his mechanical failure hit early before he got to the river portion of the fist leg.  As he was the second to last in the line up draw order......he was all alone and had to hoof it back to start of the race, get his truck and trailer to retrieve his sled.....which I understand ....was something he debated doing.  :-).    ?In true Team Mattison fashion. Jim, Pete, and Jake switched roles and became pit and support crew.??Video and photos coming soon."
17107585,1,"Saint Scholastic Virgin and Religion Founder twin sister of Benedict, died 543; Feast day Feb 10? ?PRAYER: O God, show us where innocence leads, You made the soul of Your Virgin St. Scholastic soar to heaven like a dove in flight. Grant through her merits and her prayers that we may so live in innocence as to attain to joys everlasting. This we ask through Christ our our Lord. Amen.? ?St. Scholastic was the abbess of plumbariola, the first "" Benedictine"" convent!"
17107586,1,"Saint Scholastica?Abbess?(480-543)??Of this Saint but little is known on earth, save that she was the very pious younger sister of the great patriarch Saint Benedict, and that, under his direction, she founded and governed a numerous community near Monte Casino. Saint Gregory sums up her life by saying that she devoted herself to God from her childhood, and that her pure soul rose to God in the likeness of a dove, as if to show that her life had been enriched with the fullest gifts of the Holy Spirit.??Her brother was accustomed to visit her once every year, before Lent, and she could not be sated or wearied with the words of grace which flowed from his lips. On his last visit, after a day passed in spiritual conversation, the Saint, knowing that her end was near, said, My brother, leave me not, I pray you, this night, but discourse with me till dawn on the bliss of those who see God in heaven. Saint Benedict would not break his rule for the sake of natural affection, but his sister bowed her head and prayed, and there arose a storm so violent that Saint Benedict could not return to his monastery, and they passed the night as she had prayed, in heavenly conversation.??Three days later Saint Benedict saw in a vision the soul of Saint Scholastica going up in the likeness of a dove into heaven. Then he gave thanks to God for the graces He had given her and the glory which had crowned them. When she died, Saint Benedict as well as her spiritual daughters, and the monks sent by their patriarch to her conventual church, mingled their tears and prayed, Alas! alas! dearest mother, to whom dost thou leave us now? Pray for us to Jesus, to whom thou art gone. They then devoutly celebrated holy Mass, commending her soul to God; and her body was borne to Monte Casino, where her brother lay her in the tomb he had prepared for himself. It was written that they all mourned her many days. Finally Saint Benedict said, Weep not, my sisters and brothers; for assuredly Jesus has taken her, before us, to be our aid and defence against all our enemies, that we may remain standing on the evil day and be perfect in all things. Her death occurred in about the year 543."
17107584,1,"Dealing with Interruptions and Interrupters.? ?""Promise me, women of Jerusalem; swear by the swift deer and the gazelles that you will not interrupt our love.""?Son 2:7 GNB? ?What a matter You are showing me in your word today! All along in this study from the Songs of Solomon, I have come across these daughters of Jerusalem. They are either mocking or coming in between. They are either creating interruptions in the flow of thoughts between the bride and the groom or they are creating scenes of distraction. I must learn how to deal with these women decisively. In this allegory, they appear so soft and sophisticated like cosmetic women. But they just represent the world system and all its attractions away from the things of the Spirit. They will come in between my soul and the Saviour. They will fill me with mundane things that I may not have space and time for my Lord again. They will like to stick to me as if I have any destiny with them.?? “I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, By the roes, or by the hinds of the field, That you not stir up, nor awaken love, Until it so desires.” (WEB) comes so strong a way of dealing with a menace on my path to the higher ground. It has to take the violence of my will to extricate myself from their clutch. Even if they were to make a promise, it is nothing for the daughters of Jerusalem to break their vow. They are bent on mischief. What I need is to take my stand and come away with my Lord and Lover. I must close my eyes to the temporary help I will receive of these daughters of Jerusalem. Lord, this is the point. I need to break forcefully away from everything that hinders me from walking in intimacy with you. I need to seek a release from calls and invitation that takes me away from the place of communion.?? Rise up and come away? ?""My beloved spoke, and said to me: ""Rise up, my love, my fair one, And come away. For lo, the winter is past, The rain is over and gone. The flowers appear on the earth; The time of singing has come, And the voice of the turtledove Is heard in our land. The fig tree puts forth her green figs, And the vines with the tender grapes Give a good smell. Rise up, my love, my fair one, And come away!""?Son 2:10-13 NKJV? ?This is the counsel of the Lord to His bride. It is the same counsel the Lord has been bringing to me over and over again. No one has ever escaped the clutch of the world system unless he has heeded this call: Come away. Arise and come away is the way out of this situation. The secret of intimacy with God is the secret place. Jesus went away. Paul went away. Moses went away. Daniel went away. All the men who impacted their generation in a significant way went away to the solitary place, in the cleft of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, on the mountains, in gardens to be with Him and to seek His face. I cannot do otherwise!? ?""O My dove, in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let Me see your face, let Me hear your voice; for your voice is sweet, and your face is beautiful.""?Son 2:14? ?There is a longing in His heart for me to come and be with Him. Lord, help me to come away from everything and everyone so as to be alone with you. I long for You to hear my voice and for me to hear Yours in a new and personal way. Lord I have heard this invitation again. I long to come away into the mountains apart and let me just remain quiet with You. Lend me your wisdom to bail me out of so many demands to release myself out here to come away with you in Jesus name. Grant me boldness to skip even food that my inner man may feed more deeply at your feet. Deliver me from addictions to men, to food, to breakfast, such that will rob me of early appointment with You.?? I must rise a great while before day to begin my soul-climb otherwise I may be caught in the web of activities. I may need to discharge myself from men early in the evenings so I can catch up with You on issues of importance. I feel this is a revival You are bringing to my soul, as a preservation of the Day You have broken for me to affect the Church in this generation. Help me to come away. The apostles knew that it was not proper for them to continue to dissipate their lives with the daily business of serving tables. They looked for relief managers, so they can be free to devote themselves to prayer and the ministry of the word. This brought increase to the work as the number of disciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem. Lend me their wisdom O Lord!?? ""Rise up, my love, my fair one, And come away. For lo, the winter is past, The rain is over and gone. The flowers appear on the earth?? Fighting these daughters of Jerusalem is one thing but the crucial way is to rise up and come away. The winter is past, the rain is over and gone. To tarry here is to eat the dregs and to become perforated. The flowers that have appeared will soon wither and fall on the ground. Come away to the place of refreshing and fresh budding. And here also is my feeble but sincere reponse…? ?I am thine O Lord and I have heard thy voice, as it told thy love to me…? But I long to rise, in the arms of faith and be closer drawn to Thee.?? Draw me nearer, nearer blessed Lord to the Cross where thou has died;? Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer, blessed Lord, to thy precious bleeding side"

17107424,1,"I am going to post this Q&A again because it is important to read if you are concerned about the changes happening on our farm. It directly addresses the comments and questions we have received from the public. Please read and share, thank you again.?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------??                 Q & A: “From a Farmer’s Point of View”?              Edwin Fry, owner, MD Sunrise Farm, LLC??Q: What were the problems facing the farm that made you feel you needed to cease farming the grain fields organically? How did you come to this decision, what factors did you weigh???A: We began considering the option of changing our protocol in the fall of 2013 when it was time to plant alfalfa, a 3 year crop, and we didn’t have a lease with the landlord. Our crops, the past three years, have been heavily infested with volunteer weeds and the weed seed bank has become unmanageable. (If you think about the soil like a traditional financial bank, every time a weed matures, flowers, and deposits seeds back into the soil, it’s like putting money into the bank. It’s there in the future. Some of those seeds could lay dormant for months or years and when conditions are right for that seed, they can germinate. Each year we were being increasingly challenged by weeds, especially specific types of weeds that are very difficult to deal with organically. This past year we had significant pressure from cocklebur. The difficulty with cocklebur is when you harvest the grain; it’s very difficult to separate the cocklebur out. Grain with significant cocklebur in it is not saleable.) The mechanical cultivation used to control weeds in organic land has caused erosion on some parts of the farm . Finally, the majority of the soils on the farm are high in phosphorus “P” (due to nearly a century of applying dairy manure under Navy management) and the proposed phosphorus management tool “PMT” regulation by the MD Dept. of Agriculture will make it difficult to use chicken manure as a source of fertilizer for organic corn production in the future.??Q: I worked hard to keep this land in organic farming when the ideas of the horse park and soccer fields were raised. I feel betrayed! ??A: We remember the degree of community involvement in 2005-06 very well.  That’s where we got to know many of the neighbors and understand the sense of ownership you feel for the farm. ?Marian and I are sorry that you feel betrayed. Agriculture, like other sciences, is continually evolving.  I am a firm believer in organic farming, but I have a higher calling to good land stewardship. As a business person, when my business ideals conflict with the results, I don’t give up my ideal - sustainability and stewardship - but I do modify my methodology to work toward that goal. With the particular challenges facing this property and the sediment losses from rain events on plowed ground that were running off into the tributaries of the farm, we felt a different protocol focusing on soil health, building organic matter (that helps hold the soil in place without the same kind of negative effects that weeds provide on crops) and halting erosion and soil loss was the most responsible crop program we could adopt. ??Q: What were your plans about letting immediate neighbors in the area know about these changes???A: After talking with our Recreation and Parks POC about our concerns for the farm, and confirming with the county’s legal counsel that the lease didn’t require the farm to remain certified organic, we needed to make a business decision by the time our annual organic certification inspection took place in Dec. 2013.  We made the decision not to recertify the cropland or beef herd and wrote a public?statement (that was put on our Facebook page) because we value transparency and knew our neighbors would expect to be informed of the change.  This capsule explanation, written in December 2013, was given out as requested well in advance of any changes in land use protocol. We know many area residents and we had an expectation that they would contact us directly if they had further questions or wanted to voice their concerns.  Although there has been significant internet speculation about the farm, very few people have requested more in depth explanations from us or our farm staff. ??Q: I am afraid that the Fry’s don’t care about our area, this property or the neighbors. I’m afraid they are not invested in this place because they reside elsewhere. ??A: We have been a small business owner in Anne Arundel County for 13 years. Working as MD Sunrise Farm, we have become invested in the health and wellbeing of this land and this community. We developed our market garden and CSA specifically so the farm would produce food that could be consumed in the county. We host the Anne Arundel 4-H Dairy Leasing Club.?Our daughter’s family lives in Odenton, attends The Ark and The Dove Church, and our grandsons go to Four Seasons Elementary and 2 local nursery schools in Crofton. Our son-in-law, David, is stationed at Ft. Meade and keeps bee hives and an orchid greenhouse on the farm.  Our grandson takes riding lessons at MD Sunrise Farm and the family is looking forward to joining 4-H. Their neighbors are among our 2014 CSA members.  As an extended family, we are involved community stakeholders. ??A: I equate non-organic farming with pollution that will be harmful to my health and my family’s health. I feel this land is paid for by my taxes and I don’t want any “toxins” on it or anything that could adversely impact me.??Q: Even with conventional (the term farmers use for certain “non-organic” farming methods) farming practices, MD farmers are required to have a Nutrient Management Plan (NMP) administered by MDA.  As organic farmers, we followed a NMP and will continue to do so. The plan is based on the results of soil tests and indicates the amount and kind of nutrients (fertilizer) that can be applied to a specific crop. The goal is to have the growing crops use the available nutrients already in the soil and prevent additional nutrient loading in the bay. We will be planting non-GMO soybeans.  In considering herbicide or pesticide application levels, we plan to use one pre-emergent and one post-emergent herbicide application for grass and broadleaf weeds. An agronomist working for A.E.T. Consulting will scout the fields every two weeks for disease or pest infestation. If an economic loss threshold is surpassed, triggering the need for a pesticide, we will first consider biological methods to save the crop, the way we do when farming under organic protocols.??Q: It seems to me that the Fry’s care about Kent County enough to continue to farm organically there but they don’t care enough about this area to invest more money to remain organic here. ??A: Some problems aren’t solved by throwing more money at them. Even if you had a different farmer, the soil erosion and weed bank management would still need to be addressed. Our good faith efforts with our certified organic crop practices haven’t produced the hoped for result in land stewardship.  We are committed to positive change that is safe for the farm and for our neighbors. We have been working?with the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and the MD Fish and Wildlife Service to improve the waterways, remove non-native trees, add permanent fencing to keep cattle out of the intermittent stream areas, and to establish man made wetlands in two areas of the farm to improve water filtration and increase wildlife habitat. ??Q: Does this mean that the Dairy Farm will never be organic again? How could it become organic again? Living near an organically certified farm is very important to me, when could it go back into organic production?!??A: “The Dairy Farm” is an historic name but no cows have been milked here since 1997. It has been certified organic for 13 years. When we are able to develop a sustainable model using no-til and multispecies covercrops (two methods designed to prevent erosion) to stabilize and revitalize the soils, and combat the weed bank, then we can consider returning to a different organic protocol that includes notil farming. I refer you to this link; http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE2DBD6E94D67397B?to learn more about the multispecies cover crops and healthy soils. It takes 36 months of transition farming to become certified organic.??Q: I’m worried that the herbicides and pesticides you are putting on the farm will get into your organic vegetables, bees, beef and my garden that sits nearby! I don’t want those toxins in my food or well water! ??A: The certification for our vegetable garden has exactly the same requirements, dictated by the National Organic Program (NOP), with which all other certified organic vegetable producing land must comply. All certified organic lands are required to have a 25 foot buffer zone between them and non-organic land. Although we are not recertifying our cropland, we are committed to using safe agricultural practices as defined by law. There will be NO aerial application of herbicides or pesticides. The pastures where the beef graze are managed by intensive rotational grazing where the beef act as lawn mowers, and are moved daily to new paddocks. ??Q: Are there any environmental benefits to the changes proposed for the farm???A: Yes, the use of no-til reduces the amount of diesel fuel used by 83% (ref.  Archives of Agronomy and Soil Science Dec. 2013) which mitigates CO2 emissions by 50%. The soil sediment loss (erosion) is reduced from 3.7% to .6% (ref. Purdue Cooperative Extension Publication Jan. 1995). Approximately 15 acres of rowcrop land will be seeded to permanent pasture and fenced for rotational grazing. The multispecies covercrop (crops that are planted specifically to keep soil from eroding or blowing in the winter and will not be sold) will create abundant winter habitat for birds and small wild animal species in addition to winter forage for the beef cattle. ??Q: The toxic chemicals are going to kill the bee colonies that have been established on the farm.??A: According to beekeeper Joe Brotherton, who has honeybee hives at MD Sunrise Farm, the chemical of greatest concern for bees is a class of insecticides called neonicotinoids which affects the central?nervous system of insects.  Because we know this, we won’t use that insecticide class should we need to use pest control.?In an effort to preserve pollinator habitat, our son-in-law David, also a beekeeper, plans to plant Seedland’s Honey Bee Wildflower Seed Mix (www.seedland.com) along the perimeters of crop fields, in marginal cropland, and along the edges of wild land areas on the farm.  Our pasture area will also include white clover which is a good nectar source.??Q: I am paying a lot of money in taxes for the lease on land that I don’t perceive I get any value from, but you do. Before, I thought, “At least it’s organic and it’s not contributing to the pollution of the area.” Now it won’t even be organic; what do I gain from this?!??A: By federal law (Congressman Wayne Gilchrest, 1997), this land owned by the US Navy must remain in agriculture. In fulfillment of this requirement, our privately owned business is the current agricultural sub-lessee of the county. MD Sunrise Farm pays rent, insures leased buildings, pays leasehold interest property taxes to AA Co., and provides ground maintenance on the entire property.?Anne Arundel County entered into a long-term lease with the Navy and spent 1 year with citizen input to develop plans for a nature oriented history park at this site to be called “Hammond’s Connection at the Dairy Farm. In addition to other park features, the plan calls for 90 public garden plots.  ?In 2013 AA Co. relocated the Univ. of MD Cooperative Extension Service offices to the farm.  Extension services are available to all Anne Arundel County citizens. This location provides a particular benefit to the Master Gardeners and creates an easy interface with Recreation and Parks as they have periodic public events at the farm.   ??Q: I’m sorry that organic farming didn’t work out this year for the Fry’s but I don’t want the land stripped of its organic certification. What happens if MD Sunrise Farm leaves the dairy farm? How will it affect the farm and us? Can’t the county just bring in another organic farmer who is willing to live there or turn the property into a park???A: The organic certification application is updated and submitted by MD Sunrise Farm annually. Our certifier, The MD Department of Agriculture, must annually review the application and inspect the farm and the record keeping of the farmer to certify the land and business, allowing the business to sell product with the “Certified Organic” label.?If MD Sunrise leaves the farm, a new farmer must complete an application demonstrating their business practices are in compliance with the National Organic Program and demonstrate to a USDA approved certifying agency their ability to manage 600 acres of organic land. The organic certificate is specific to the site and to the business that submitted it and is not transferable.  This would mean that the certified organic market garden at the farm would also lose its certification if MD Sunrise Farm, LLC leaves.?What happens to the farm in the absence of the current agricultural tenant would be up to the county to determine."

17107085,1,"Saint of the Day?St. Scholastica?(480-542?)??Twins often share the same interests and ideas with an equal intensity. Therefore, it is no surprise that Scholastica and her twin brother, Benedict (July 11), established religious communities within a few miles from each other.??Born in 480 of wealthy parents, Scholastica and Benedict were brought up together until he left central Italy for Rome to continue his studies.??Little is known of Scholastica’s early life. She founded a religious community for women near Monte Cassino at Plombariola, five miles from where her brother governed a monastery.??The twins visited each other once a year in a farmhouse because Scholastica was not permitted inside the monastery. They spent these times discussing spiritual matters.??According to the Dialogues of St. Gregory the Great, the brother and sister spent their last day together in prayer and conversation. Scholastica sensed her death was close at hand and she begged Benedict to stay with her until the next day.??He refused her request because he did not want to spend a night outside the monastery, thus breaking his own Rule. Scholastica asked God to let her brother remain and a severe thunderstorm broke out, preventing Benedict and his monks from returning to the abbey.??Benedict cried out, “God forgive you, Sister. What have you done?” Scholastica replied, “I asked a favor of you and you refused. I asked it of God and he granted it.”??Brother and sister parted the next morning after their long discussion. Three days later, Benedict was praying in his monastery and saw the soul of his sister rising heavenward in the form of a white dove. Benedict then announced the death of his sister to the monks and later buried her in the tomb he had prepared for himself.??Comment:??Scholastica and Benedict gave themselves totally to God and gave top priority to deepening their friendship with him through prayer. They sacrificed some of the opportunities they would have had to be together as brother and sister in order better to fulfill their vocation to the religious life. In coming closer to Christ, however, they found they were also closer to each other. In joining a religious community, they did not forget or forsake their family but rather found more brothers and sisters.??Quote:??“All religious are under an obligation, in accordance with the particular vocation of each, to work zealously and diligently for the building up and growth of the whole mystical body of Christ and for the good of the particular churches.

17106990,1,"An aspiring author and friend of mine is new to baking.  When she made her first ever apple pie from scratch, it looked gorgeous, perfectly browned and steaming from the oven. She was so proud of herself she invited me over for a spontaneous quick bite of pie. We took the first bite, anticipating…and then our eyes opened wide in shock. What she’d thought was white sugar was, instead, salt. My friend could have freaked out, sobbed, or vowed she’d never bake again. Instead, as we both dove for our water glasses, she commented, “Well, that was unique. Think I just found a whoopsy-daisy in the ingredients. Want to try it again next week, but with sugar this time?” Wow. Now that’s seasoned life perspective. For writers, it’s also good advice. Sometimes you’ll write something that should be for no one’s eyes but yours. But don’t ever quit. Just try it again!"
17106964,1,"SOD: St. Scholastica (480-543)--Twin sister of St. Benedict. As Benedict began to lay the foundations for monastic life for men in western Europe, Scholastica is said to have done the same in a women's monastery at the foot of Monte Cassino, where Benedict and his community lived southeast of Rome.??According to ""The Dialogues"" of St. Gregory the Great, the twins would visit each other once a year. Near the end of Scholastica's life, she did not want the visit to end and so prayed--successfully--for a thunderstorm that would keep Benedict from going back to his monastery. Three days later, with him back at his monastery, she died. Benedict was given a vision of Scholastica's soul rising to heaven like a dove. "

17106854,1,"Matthew 10:5-31 NIV?[5] These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions: ""Do not go among the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans. [6] Go rather to the lost sheep of Israel. [7] As you go, preach this message: `The kingdom of heaven is near.' [8] Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy, drive out demons. Freely you have received, freely give. [9] Do not take along any gold or silver or copper in your belts; [10] take no bag for the journey, or extra tunic, or sandals or a staff; for the worker is worth his keep. [11] ""Whatever town or village you enter, search for some worthy person there and stay at his house until you leave. [12] As you enter the home, give it your greeting. [13] If the home is deserving, let your peace rest on it; if it is not, let your peace return to you. [14] If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that home or town. [15] I tell you the truth, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town. [16] I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves. [17] ""Be on your guard against men; they will hand you over to the local councils and flog you in their synagogues. [18] On my account you will be brought before governors and kings as witnesses to them and to the Gentiles. [19] But when they arrest you, do not worry about what to say or how to say it. At that time you will be given what to say, [20] for it will not be you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you. [21] ""Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death. [22] All men will hate you because of me, but he who stands firm to the end will be saved. [23] When you are persecuted in one place, flee to another. I tell you the truth, you will not finish going through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes. [24] ""A student is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master. [25] It is enough for the student to be like his teacher, and the servant like his master. If the head of the house has been called Beelzebub, how much more the members of his household! [26] ""So do not be afraid of them. There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known. [27] What I tell you in the dark, speak in the daylight; what is whispered in your ear, proclaim from the roofs. [28] Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell. [29] Are not two sparrows sold for a penny ? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from the will of your Father. [30] And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. [31] So don't be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows."

17106601,1,"Equally amazing to the doctrine of the Trinity is the doctrine of the Incarnation--that Jesus Christ is God and man, yet one person, forever. As J.I. Packer has said: ""Here are two mysteries for the price of one--the plurality of persons within the unity of God, and the union of Godhead and manhood in the person of Jesus. ...Nothing in fiction is so fantastic as is this truth of the Incarnation,"" writes contemporary theologian J.I. Packer.1??The early church considered the Incarnation to be one of the most important truths of our faith. Because of this, they formulated what has come to be called the Chalcedonean Creed, a statement which sets forth very what we are to believe and what we are not to believe about the Incarnation. This creed was the fruit of a large council that took place from October 8 to November 1, 451, in the city of Chalcedon and ""has been taken as the standard, orthodox definition of the biblical teaching on the person of Christ since that day by"" all the major branches of Christianity.2 There are five main truths with which the creed of Chalcedon summarized the biblical teaching on the Incarnation.??1. Jesus has two natures -- He is God and man.?2. Each nature is full and complete -- He is fully God and fully man.?3. Each nature remains distinct.?4. Christ is only one Person.?5. Things that are true of only one nature are nonetheless true of the Person of Christ.?A proper understanding of these truths clears up much confusion and many difficulties we may have in our mind. How can Jesus be both God and man? Why doesn't this make Him two people? How does His Incarnation relate to the Trinity? How could Jesus have hungered (Matthew 4:2) and died (Mark 15:37) when He was on earth, and yet still be God? Did Jesus give up any of His divine attributes in the Incarnation? Why is it inaccurate to say that Jesus is a ""part"" of God? Is Jesus still human now, and does He still have His human body???Jesus has two natures -- God and man??The first truth we need to understand is that Jesus is one Person who has two natures a divine nature and a human nature. In other words, Jesus is both God and man. We will look at each nature accordingly.??Jesus is God??The Bible teaches that Jesus is not merely someone who is a lot like God, or someone who has a very close walk with God. Rather, Jesus is the Most High God Himself. Titus 2:13 says that as Christians we are ""looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Christ Jesus."" Upon seeing the resurrected Christ, Thomas cried out, ""My Lord and my God!"" (John 20:28). Likewise, the book of Hebrews gives us God the Father's direct testimony about Christ: ""But of the Son He says, 'Thy throne, O God, is forever and ever"" and the gospel of John calls Jesus ""the only begotten God"" (John 1:18).??Another way the Bible teaches that Jesus is God is by showing that He has all of the attributes of God. He knows everything (Mt 16:21; Luke 11:17; John 4:29), is everywhere (Matthew 18:20; 28:20; Acts 18:10), has all power (Mt 8:26, 27; 28:18; Jn 11:38-44; Lk 7:14-15; Revelation 1:8), depends on nothing outside of Himself for life (Jn 1:4; 14:6; 8:58), rules over everything (Mt 28:18; Rev 19:16; 1:5) never began to exist and never will cease to exist (John 1:1; 8:58), and is our Creator (Colossians 1:16). In other words, everything that God is, Jesus is. For Jesus is God. ??Specifically, Jesus is God the Son??In order to have a more complete grasp of Christ's incarnation, it is necessary to have some sort of understanding of the Trinity. The doctrine of the Trinity states that God is one being, and this one God exists as three distinct Persons. This means, first of all, that we must distinguish each Person of the Trinity from the other two. The Father is not the Son or the Holy Spirit, the Son is not the Holy Spirit or the Father, and the Holy Spirit is not the Father or the Son. They are each a distinct center of consciousness, a distinct form of personal existence. Yet, they all share the exact same divine nature/essence. Thus, the three persons are one being. The divine being/essence is not something that is divided between the Persons, each Person receiving one-third. Rather, the divine being is fully and equally possessed by all three Persons such that all three Persons are each fully and equally God. ??How does the fact that God is three Persons in one Being relate to the incarnation? To answer this, let's consider another question. Which Person became incarnate in Jesus Christ? All three? Or just one? Which one? The Biblical answer is that only God the Son became incarnate. The Father did not become incarnate in Jesus, and neither did the Holy Spirit. Thus, Jesus is God, but He is not the Father or the Holy Spirit. Jesus is God the Son.??The truth that it is only God the Son who became incarnate is taught, for example, in John 1:14, which says ""And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth."" In context, the word is God the Son (cf. vv. 1, 18, and 3:16). Thus, it wasn't the Father or the Holy Spirit who became man, but God the Son. ??Likewise, at Jesus' baptism we see the Father affirming ""Thou art My beloved Son, in Thee I am well-pleased"" (Luke 3:22). He did not say, ""You are me, and with myself I am well-pleased."" Rather, the Father affirmed that Jesus is the Son, His Son, and that Jesus is well-pleasing to Him. In this same verse we also see that the Holy Spirit is distinct from the Father and the Son, for the Holy Spirit is present in ""bodily form like a dove.""??Why is it important to know that Jesus is specifically God the Son? For one thing, if we do not understand this we will be mistaken about the very identity of our savior. Further, it greatly affects how we relate to our triune God. If we think that Jesus is the Father and/or the Holy Spirit, we will be greatly misguided and confused in our prayers. Last, it is considered heresy to believe that the Father became incarnate in Jesus. ??Jesus is man??It should be obvious that if Jesus is God, then He has always been God. There was a never a time when He became God, for God is eternal. But Jesus has not always been man. The fantastic miracle is that this eternal God became man at the Incarnation approximately 2,000 years ago. That's what the Incarnation was--God the Son becoming man. And its this great even that we celebrate at Christmas. ??But what exactly do we mean when we say that God the Son became man? We certainly do not mean that He turned into a man, in the sense that He stopped being God and started being man. Jesus did not give up any of His divinity in the Incarnation, as is evident from the verses we saw earlier. Rather, as one early theologian put it, ""Remaining what He was, He became what He was not."" Christ ""was not now God minus some elements of His deity, but God plus all that He had made His own by taking manhood to Himself.""3 Thus, Jesus did not give up any of His divine attributes at the Incarnation. He remained in full possession of all of them. For if He were to ever give up any of His divine attributes, He would cease being God. ??The truth of Jesus' humanity is just as important to hold to as the truth of His deity. The apostle John speaks strongly anyone that denying that Jesus is man is of the spirit of the anti-Christ (1 John 4:2; 2 John 7). Jesus' humanity is displayed in the fact that He was born as a baby from a human mother (Luke 2:7; Galatians 4:4), that He became weary (John 4:6), thirsty (John 19:28), and hungry (Matthew 4:2), and that He experienced the full range of human emotions such as marvel (Matt. 8:10), weeping, and sorrow (John 11:35). He lived on earth just as we do. ??Jesus is a sinless man??It is also essential to know that Christ does not have a sinful nature, and neither did He ever commit sin -- even though He was tempted in all ways (Hebrews 4:15). Thus, Jesus is fully and perfectly man, and has also experienced the full range of human experience. We have a Savior who can truly identify with us because He is man, and who can also truly help us in temptation because He has never sinned. This is an awesome truth to cherish, and sets Christianity apart from all other religions. ??Each nature is full and complete??Having seen the biblical basis that Jesus is both God and man, the second truth that we must recognize is that each of Christ's natures is full and complete. In other words, Jesus is fully God and fully man. Another helpful way to say it is that Jesus is 100% God and 100% man.??Jesus is fully God??We saw earlier that each Person of the Trinity is fully God. The three Persons of the Trinity are not each one-third of God, but are each all of God. Thus, Jesus is fully God since He is God the Son incarnate. This means that everything that is essential to being God is true of Jesus. Jesus is not part of God, or one-third of God. Rather, He is fully God. ""For in Him all the fullness of Deity dwells in bodily form"" (Colossians 2:9).??Jesus is fully man??It is also important to recognize that when we say that Jesus is man, we do not simply mean that He is partially man. We mean that He is fully human -- everything that belongs to the essence of true humanity is true of Him. He is just as truly human as the rest of us. ??The fact that Jesus is truly and fully human is clear from the fact that He has a human body (Luke 24:39), a human mind (Luke 2:52), and a human soul (Matthew 26:38). Jesus does not just look like a man, He does not just have some aspects of what is essential for true humanity but not others, but possess full humanity. ??It is helpful to be aware of the false views concerning Christ. For if we have a grasp of what we are not to believe, it will give us a fuller picture of what we are to believe. One of the false views that was rejected at the council of Chalcedon taught that ""the one person of Christ had a human body but not a human mind or spirit, and that the mind and spirit of Christ were from the divine nature of the Son of God.""4 Since this view did not believe that Jesus has a human mind and spirit, it in effect denied that Christ is fully and truly man. Rather, it presented Christ as a sort of half-man who has a human body, but whose human mind and soul were replaced by the divine nature. But as we saw earlier, Jesus is just as fully human as the rest of us, for just as He has all of the essential elements of Godhead, He has all the essential elements of human nature a human body, a human soul, a human mind, a human will, and human emotions. His human mind was not replaced by His divine mind. Rather, He has both a human and divine mind. For these reasons, it can be misleading to use phrases such as ""Jesus is God in a body"" or ""Jesus is God with skin on."" ??Jesus will be fully God and fully man forever??For most people it is obvious that Jesus will be God forever. But for some reason it escapes a lot of us that Jesus will also be man forever. He is still man right now as you read this and will be forever. The Bible is clear that Jesus rose physically from the dead in the same body that had died (Luke 24:39) and then ascended into heaven as a man, in His physical body (Acts 1:9; Luke 24:50-51). It would make no sense for Him to have done this if He was simply going to ditch His body and stop being man when He arrived in heaven.??That Christ continued being man, with a physical body, after His ascension is confirmed by the fact that when He returns, it will be as man, in His body. He will return physically. Philippians 3:21 says that at His Second Coming, Christ ""will transform the body of our humble state into conformity with the body of His glory."" This verse is clear that Jesus still has His body. It is a glorified body, which Paul calls ""the body of His glory."" And when Christ returns, He will still have it because this verse says that He will transform our bodies to be like His. Both Jesus and all Christians will then continue living together in their bodies forever, because the resurrection body cannot die (1 Corinthians 15:42) because it is eternal (2 Corinthians 5:1).??Why did Jesus become man, and why will He be man forever? The book of Hebrews says that it was so that Christ could be an adequate Savior who has all that we need. ""He had to be made like His brethren in all things, that He might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people"" (2:17). First, notice that Jesus became man so that He could die for our sins. He had to be human in order to pay the penalty for humans. Second, this verse says that because Jesus is human like us, He is able to be a merciful and faithful high priest. His humanity enables Him to more fully sympathize with us and identify with us. I cannot help but believe that it is very destructive to our comfort and faith to not know that Jesus is still man and in His body. For if He is not still man in heaven, how could we have comfort knowing that He can fully sympathize with us? He can sympathize and be a faithful high priest and know what we are going through not just because He was once on earth as a man, but because He continues forever as that same man. ??Each nature remains distinct??The truths of Christ's two natures full manhood and full Godhood are pretty well understood and known by Christians. But for a right understanding of the Incarnation we must go even further. We must understand that the two natures of Christ remain distinct and retain their own properties. What does this mean? Two things: (1) They do not alter one another's essential properties, and (2) neither do they mix together into a mysterious third kind of nature. ??First, it would be wrong to think that Christ's two natures mix together to form a third kind of nature. This is one of the heresies that the early church had to fight. This heresy taught that ""the human nature of Christ was taken up and absorbed into the divine nature, so that both natures were changed somewhat and a third kind of nature resulted. An analogy to [this] can be seen if we put a drop of ink in a glass of water: the mixture resulting is neither pure ink nor pure water, but some kind of third substance, a mixture of the two in which both the ink and the water are changed. Similarly, [this view] taught that Jesus was a mixture of divine and human elements in which both were somewhat modified to form one new nature.""5 This view is unbiblical because it demolishes both Christ's deity and humanity. For if Christ's two natures mixed together, then He is no longer truly and fully God and truly and fully man, but is some entirely different kind of being that resulted from a mixture of the two natures. ??Second, even if we acknowledge that the natures do not mix together into a third kind of nature, it would also be wrong to think that the two natures changed one another. For example, it would be wrong to conclude that Jesus' human nature became divine in some ways, or that His divine nature became human in some ways. Rather, each nature remains distinct, and thereby retains its own individual properties and does not change. As the council of Chalcedon stated it, ""...the distinction of natures being by no means taken away by the union, but rather the property of each nature being preserved...""6 Jesus' human nature is human, and human only. His divine nature is divine, and divine only. For example, Jesus' human nature did not become all knowing through its union with God the Son, and neither did His divine nature become ignorant of anything. If any of the natures underwent a change in its essential nature, then Christ is no longer truly and fully human, or truly and fully divine. ??Christ is only one Person??What we have seen so far about the deity and humanity of Christ shows us that Christ has two natures -- a divine nature and a human nature -- , that each nature is full and complete, that they remain distinct and do not mix together to form a third kind of nature, and that Christ will be both God and man forever. ??But if Christ has two natures, does this mean that He is also two people? No, it does not. Christ remains one person. There is only one Christ. The church has historically stated this truth in this way: Christ is two natures united in one person forever.??At this point we find another heretical view to beware of. This view, while acknowledging that Jesus is fully God and fully man, denies that He is only one Person. According to this view, there are two separate persons in Christ as well as two natures. In contrast to this, the Bible is very clear that, while Jesus has two natures, He is only one Person. In other words, what this means is that there are not two Jesus Christ's. In spite of the fact that He has a duality of natures, He is not two Christs, but One. While remaining distinct, the two natures are united together in such a way so as to be one Person. ??To put it simply, there is a certain sense in which Christ is two, and a different sense in which Christ is one. He is two in that He has two real, full natures one divine and one human. He is one in that, while remaining distinct, these two natures exist together in such a way as that they constitute ""one thing."" In other words, the two natures are both the same Jesus, and thus are one Person. As the Chalcedonean creed says, Christ is ""to be acknowledged in two natures...concurring in one Person and one Subsistence, not parted or divided into two persons, but one and the same Son, and only begotten, God, the Word, the Lord Jesus Christ...""??Evidence that Christ is Only One Person??We will look at three pieces of the biblical teaching that while Christ has two distinct and unchanged, He nonetheless remains one Person. ??1. Both natures are represented in Scripture as constituting ""one thing,"" that is, as united in one Person. We read in John 1:14, ""And the word became flesh and dwelt among us."" Here we see the two natures: the Word (His deity) and flesh (humanity). Yet we also see that there is one Person, for we read that the Word became flesh. ""Became"" requires that we acknowledge a unity of the two natures such that they are one thing--that is, one Person. For in what sense could John write that the word became flesh if they do not constitute one Person? It surely cannot mean ""turned into"" flesh, for that is against the Scriptural teaching on the distinctness of the natures. Additional Scriptures relating to this line of evidence are Romans 8:3, Galatians 4:4, 1 Timothy 3:16, Hebrews 2:11-14, 1 John 4:2,3. ??2. Jesus never speaks of Himself as ""We,"" but always as ""I"" ??3. Many passages refer to both natures of Christ, but it is clear that only one person is intended It is impossible to read the following passages, which clearly affirm Christ's two natures, and yet conclude that Christ is two Persons. ""For what the Law could not do, weak as it was through the flesh, God did: sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and as an offering for sin, He condemned sin in the flesh..."" (Romans 8:3). ""But when the fulness of the time came, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the law..."" (Galatians 4:4). ""...who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped [that is, exploited to His own advantage], but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men"" (Philippians 2:6-7). ??Having seen that Christ is two natures in one person, and having also seen what is involved in this, we will now examine one of the major implications of this, which should help us to complete the picture and our understanding. ??Implication: Things that are true of one nature but not the other are nonetheless true of the Person of Christ??As we have seen earlier, the fact that Christ is two natures means that there are things that are true of His human nature that are not true of His divine nature. And there are things true of His divine nature that are not true of His human nature. For example, His human nature hungered, but His divine nature could never be hungry. So when Christ hungered on earth, it was His humanity that hungered, not His divine nature. ??But the truth that we are now in a position to understand, is that by virtue of the union of the natures in one Person, the things that are true of and done by only one of Christ's natures, are nonetheless true of and done by the Person of Christ. In other words, things which only one nature does can be considered to have been done by Christ Himself. Likewise, things that are true of one nature but not the other are true of the Person of Christ as a whole. What this means, in simple terms, is that if there is something that only one of Christ's natures did, He can still say, ""I did it."" ??We have many instances in Scripture which demonstrate this. For example, Jesus says in John 8:58, ""...before Abraham was born, I am."" Now, Christ's human nature did not exist before Abraham. It is Christ's divine nature that eternally exists before Abraham. But since Christ is one Person, He could say that before Abraham was, He is. ??Another example is Christ's death. God cannot die. We should never speak of Christ's death as the death of God. But humans can die, and Jesus' human nature did die. Thus, even though Jesus' divine nature did not die, we can still say that the Person of Christ experienced death because of the union of the two natures in the one Person of Christ. Because of this, Grudem says, ""by virtue of union with Jesus' human nature, his divine nature somehow tasted something of what it was like to go through death. The person of Christ experienced death.""7 ??Have you ever wondered how Jesus could say that He did not know the day or hour of His return (Matthew 24:36) even though He is omniscient (John 21:17). If Jesus is God, why didn't He know the day of His return? This is solved by our understanding that Christ is one Person with two natures. The answer is that in regards to His human nature, Jesus does not have all knowledge. Thus, in His human nature He really did not know the day or hour of His return. But in His divine nature, He does have all knowledge and thus in His divine nature He did know when He would return. ??Here comes the most fascinating part. Since the two natures are united in one Person, the fact that Christ's human nature didn't know when He would return means that the Person of Christ did not know when He would return. Thus, Jesus the Person could truly say, ""But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father alone"" (Matthew 24:36). At the same time, by virtue of His divine nature, we can also say that the Person of Christ did know when He would return. Knowledge and ignorance of the time of His return are both true of the Christ, but in different ways. In His human nature, the Person of Christ was ignorant of when He would return. In His divine nature, the Person of Christ did know when He would return. Thus, Christ Himself both knew and did not know when He would return. ??Conclusion??We have seen the biblical evidence for the fact that Christ is God the Son, He has both a divine and human nature, that each nature is full and complete, that each nature remains distinct, that Christ is nonetheless one Person, and that things which are true of one nature are true of the Person. ??The relevance of these truths to us should go without saying. For they go to the very heart of who Christ is. Knowing these truths will greatly affect the way you view Christ and will make the gospel accounts of His life come more alive. As such, this understanding will deepen our devotion to Christ.??Second, having this richer understanding of the Incarnation of God the Son should greatly enhance our worship. We will have great marvel and gladness at the fact that the eternal Person of God the Son became man forever. Our recognition of Christ's worth will be heightened. And our faith in Him will be strengthened by having this deeper understanding of who He is.??The union of Christ's deity and humanity in one Person makes it such that we have all that we need in the same Savior. How glorious. Because Jesus is God, He is all-powerful and He cannot be defeated. Because He is God, He is the only adequate Savior. Because He is God, believers are safe and can never perish; we have security. Because He is God, we can have confidence that He will empower us for the task that He commands us for. And because He is God, all people will be accountable to Him when He returns to judge the world. ??Because Jesus is man, He has experienced the same things that we do. Because He is man, He can identify with us more intimately. Because He is man, He can come to our aid as our sympathetic High Priest when we reach the limits of our human weaknesses. Because He is man, we can relate to Him--He is not far off and uninvolved. Because He is man, we cannot complain that God does not know what we are going through. He experienced it first-hand. ??Finally, we need to be ready to defend the truth of Jesus' deity, Jesus' humanity, and their joining inconfusedly in one Person . Therefore, consider committing to memory many of the verses which teach that Jesus is both God and man, and be able to explain the relationship between Christ's two natures to others. ??May we look forward to the day when we see Him face to face, and until then may the joyful hope of this day inspire in us a great diligence in serving and worshiping Him<br /><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=212327398961617&set=o.139766372884705&type=1"">Photos of ANGEL S</a><br />"

She was accustomed to visiting her brother once a year. He would come down to meet her at a place on the monastery property, not far outside the gate.??One day she came as usual and her saintly brother went with some of his disciples; they spent the whole day praising God and talking of sacred things. As night fell they had supper together.??Their spiritual conversation went on and the hour grew late. The holy nun said to her brother: “Please do not leave me tonight; let us go on until morning talking about the delights of the spiritual life.” “Sister,” he replied, “what are you saying? I simply cannot stay outside my cell.”??When she heard her brother refuse her request, the holy woman joined her hands on the table, laid her head on them and began to pray. As she raised her head from the table, there were such brilliant flashes of lightning, such great peals of thunder and such a heavy downpour of rain that neither Benedict nor his brethren could stir across the threshold of the place where they had been seated. Sadly he began to complain: “May God forgive you, sister. What have you done?” “Well,” she answered, “I asked you and you would not listen; so I asked my God and he did listen. So now go off, if you can, leave me and return to your monastery.”??Reluctant as he was to stay of his own will, he remained against his will. So it came about that they stayed awake the whole night, engrossed in their conversation about the spiritual life.??It is not surprising that she was more effective than he, since as John says, God is love, it was absolutely right that she could do more, as she loved more.??Three days later, Benedict was in his cell. Looking up to the sky, he saw his sister’s soul leave her body in the form of a dove, and fly up to the secret places of heaven. Rejoicing in her great glory, he thanked almighty God with hymns and words of praise. He then sent his brethren to bring her body to the monastery and lay it in the tomb he had prepared for himself.??Their minds had always been united in God; their bodies were to share a common grave.??#catholic #christian #jesus #spirituality #spiritualrenewal #praise #worship #artistoftheday #emi #worshipsongs #bible #tbn #trinitybrodcastingnetwork #thechurchchannel #ocp #christianmusic #christianradio #church #pastor #monk #christ #gospelmusic #liturgy #mass #catholicism #eucharist #theology #virginmary #popefrancis #saints"

17105657,1,"The American Bible Society: ""Encounter with God""??TRUST, NOT FLIGHT??Father, often my thanks and praise to You is unspoken. I now lift my voice in praise to You.??PSALM 55:1-23 - Contemporary English Version?Vs. 1-4: Listen, God, to my prayer! Don't reject my request. Please listen and help me. My thoughts are troubled, and I keep groaning, because my loud enemies shout and attack. They treat me terribly and hold angry grudges.  My heart is racing fast, and I am afraid of dying. I am trembling with fear, completely terrified. ??Vs. 6-8: I wish I had wings like a dove, so I could fly far away and be at peace. I would go and live in some distant desert. I would quickly find shelter from howling winds and raging storms. ??Vs. 9-10: Confuse my enemies, Lord! Upset their plans. Cruelty and violence are all I see in the city, and they are like guards on patrol day and night. The city is full of trouble, evil, and corruption. Troublemakers and liars freely roam the streets. ??Vs. 12-15: My enemies are not the ones who sneer and make fun. I could put up with that or even hide from them. But it was my closest friend, the one I trusted most. We enjoyed being together, and we went with others to your house, our God. All who hate me are controlled by the power of evil/ Sentence them to death and send them down alive to the world of the dead. ??Vs. 16-19: I ask for your help, Lord God, and you will keep me safe. Morning, noon, and night you hear my concerns and complaints. I am attacked from all sides, but you will rescue me unharmed by the battle. You have always ruled, and you will hear me. You will defeat my enemies because they won't turn and worship you. ??Vs. 20-21: My friend turned against me and broke his promise. His words were smoother then butter, and softer than olive oil. But hatred filled his heart, and he was ready to attack with a sword.??Vs. 22-23: Our Lord, we belong to you. We tell you what worries us, and you won't let us fall. But what about those people who are cruel and brutal? You will throw them down into the deepest pit long before their time. I trust you, Lord!??CONSIDER: ""Psalm 55 is the spiritual case-history of a man who learned to bear his burdens. Ultimately he cast his burden upon the Lord after he found other things didn't work"" (A. Leonard Griffith). The psalm is a reminder that God does support us.??THINK FURTHER: I take a pencil and paper and trace on it the triangular shape of David's thoughts as they jerk back and forth from himself towards God (called ""you"" or ""he"") and towards his enemies (called ""they"" or ""he"" and, most painfully, ""you, my close friend""). It would be best not to underestimate his desperate personal straits (""distraught"", ""anguish"", ""terrors of death"") and the anarchy abroad in the city, presumably Jerusalem, which makes him think, first of all of flight. Am I tempted to run away from some situation, some struggle, some person, which I ought to face? ??Worst of all is the treachery of a former soul-friend who has violated the covenant of friendship and whose smooth talk now stabs like a sword. I recollect that the Gospels draw attention to the fact that Judas was ""one of the twelve"" (Mark 14:43), Jesus' innermost circle. I also sorrowfully recall David's own fatal treachery toward Uriah, one of his top 30 friends (2 Samuel 23:39). Am I myself guilty of some practices that I publicly deplore? ??In this psalm we observe with relief how sorrow and anger, fear and desperation, and panic and faith interact in a psalm of lament, which is also God’s revelation. God is not a stranger to our sorrow; he is the best destination for vengeful thoughts - justified or not. This psalm and others like it set before us a path to follow away from selfish flight and avoidance, through constant prayer, to a God who reigns. It leads me to the conviction that I may cast ""whatever my lot is"" upon the Lord, not so that he will swiftly remove it, but so that he will sustain me through it. Yes, Lord, I will in You. ??APPLY: How do you tend to respond to problems? Deny they exist? Blame someone else? Escape? Tackle them head-on? What can you learn from the psalmist? ??Loving father, life serves up problems large and small. May I always trust You, not as a last chance but as a first choice. Amen."

Markets will be hoping for reassurance that policy will stay loose for a long time to come.??The dollar had begun to retreat as European trading gathered pace, softened by questions over Yellen's stance and what if any impact a second successive month of uncertain jobs data could have on the Fed's stimulus withdrawal.??It was last trading at $1.3644 to the euro and was buying 102.20 yen, a turnaround from Asian trading when it had bobbed as high as 102.41.??""I think the market is bit on the dovish side of where it should be,"" Saxo Capital Markets chairman Nick Beecroft said.??""Given the perception of Janet Yellen being a dove, if she doesn't come over extra-dovish it could be a bit of a disappointment.""??Both stocks and the dollar initially retreated when Friday's U.S. payrolls report showed a rise of only 113,000 in January, falling well short of forecasts. The damage was limited by a very strong household survey in which a sharp jump in the number of people employed nudged the jobless rate down to 6.6 percent.??That mixed bag of data left Treasuries little changed with yields on 10-year notes a shade lower at 2.67 percent in early Monday trade.??In commodities, oil prices lost momentum having initially extended their recent gains as persistently cold weather across the United States continued to eat into heating fuel stocks.??U.S. crude made an early six-week peak at $100.46 a barrel but could not force its way past the December high at $100.75. Brent crude oil futures gave up 21 cents of last week's gains to stand at $109.35 a barrel.??Spot gold was also firm at $1,271.70 an ounce, but faces stiff resistance from $1,273 to $1,278.??YELLEN FROM THE HILL??Japan's Nikkei led the way in Asian trading, with a rise of 1.3 percent to 14,668, and away from last week's trough at 13,995. Shanghai also added 1.7 percent after its recent sell-off.??But emerging market tensions were back in focus after credit rating downgrades late on Friday for Turkey and Ukraine, two of the countries most under fire in markets.??Turkey's lira and its main stock market suffered their biggest falls in a week although losses in Ukrainian assets were limited by its imposition from Friday of capital controls.??Expectations that cuts in U.S. monetary stimulus, which has buoyed risk assets for several years, are one of the main reasons for the pressure being seen in emerging markets.??Fed chair Yellen will be able to offer her own reading of the jobs report before lawmakers this week, which could give markets a fresh steer on the pace of stimulus withdrawal.??Analysts generally assume she will stick to the script of recent policy meetings, reiterating that a gradual decline in asset buying is likely as long as the economy continues to improve as assumed.??""We expect her to state that tapering is not on a pre-set course and the committee will adjust course as needed, particularly if the expected firming in growth and gains in payrolls do not persist,"" Barclays analysts said in a note.??Yellen is also likely to repeat the standard forward guidance that the funds rate will remain near zero until the unemployment rate falls well below 6.5 percent, as long as inflation is subdued."

17105375,1,"For the leaders of this people cause them to err; and they that are led of them are destroyed.—Isaiah 9:16??""Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.""—Luke 16:15??The inner circle of the Illuminati has finally chosen the man who is to be successor to their faithful stooge and mouthpiece, Billy Graham. Already, the controlled media is busy exalting and publicizing to the world the man the Illuminati elite have chosen to succeed the ailing and aging evangelist, Billy Graham.??Billy Graham, of course, wanted his son, Franklin, to fill the post. But the Illuminati nixed Franklin, pointing out both his lack of charisma and his checkered past as obstacles.??Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson, and others were also rejected—too old, too shop-worn, too much ""excess baggage.""??Bishop T.D. Jakes?Bishop T.D. Jakes??The new Billy Graham is the man I have for months predicted would be the elite's new ""Christian"" superstar. His name is T.D. Jakes. Jakes, a Pentecostal-Charismatic pastor and self-styled ""Bishop"" from South Dallas, in Texas, is the perfect ""fit"" for the job of religious front man.??Jakes is a Feminist, a Liberal, and a Supporter of Clinton and Gore?First, he's a feminist who rattles on nonstop in his sermons about the ""need to empower women."" Jake's 1993 book, Woman, Thou Art Loosed!, sold over two million copies.??Second, Bishop T.D. Jakes is a liberal and a Democratic Party supporter. During the last presidential campaign, Jakes and black pastor cronies invited their preferred candidate, Democrat Al Gore, into the pulpit of Jakes' 26,000-member Potter's House megachurch. In a pompous show of religiosity, they laid hands on Gore to give him the ""anointing"" he would need for the presidential campaign. Evidently, their anointing didn't take hold-Gore lost to Bush in an election squeaker.??A third reason why the Illuminati elite have tagged Jakes to be spokesperson and salesman for their masonic version of ""God"" is that Jakes has proven loyal to their immoral cause. For example, during the impeachment hearings of former President Bill Clinton, Jakes went to the airwaves to try and bail Clinton out. On CNN's The Larry King Show, Jakes insisted that adultery wasn't a big deal and suggested that Clinton was a great President who deserved to stay in office. ""Leave Clinton alone,"" Jakes trumpeted.??Jakes likened those who wanted Bill Clinton to be brought to justice to ""a lynch mob."" Using the race card, he compared the criticism of Clinton's misconduct to the ""lynching of black people.""??T.D. Jakes?Bishop Jakes lays hands on one of his many Charismatic female (black and white) admirers.??""I Want My Stuff!""?Bishop T.D. Jakes is also acceptable because he's both ecumenical and heretical—two traits greatly admired by the Illuminati. Jakes is a big star on weird TV's greatest religious big-top circus, Paul and Jan Crouch's Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN). He's a tongues-talker into all kinds of unscriptural doctrinal malarkey. Jakes is a popular speaker at Promise Keepers and other ecumenical meetings.??A promoter of the prosperity gospel and of ""cultural diversity,"" Jakes dresses and acts the part as he emphasizes TBN's Word of Faith, ""name it and claim it"" propaganda. He tells people God wants to make them rich. He mesmerizes his female audience with emotional psychobabble. Jakes is a master con-man who can get audiences of thousands carnally chanting their demand to God, ""I want my stuff! I want my stuff! I want my stuff!""??""Jesus was a Rich Man,"" says Jakes?The scriptures tell us that Jesus was a poor son of a carpenter who once exclaimed that he didn't even have a foxhole to call his own. But Jakes says that is not so. ""Jesus,"" Jakes assures the greedy, ""was a rich man—had servants and a mansion.""??That explains for his audience why Jakes, too, is fabulously wealthy. Jakes and his wife live in a $1.7 million mansion in a ritzy neighborhood next to the estate of the late oil magnate, H. L. Hunt. He sports a giant diamond ring, wears $3,000 tailored suits, and stays in the most luxurious of hotel suites.??But it's all O.K.—after all, Jesus did it, too!??""Oprah in a pulpit""?Finally, Bishop T.D. Jakes is the Illuminati's successor to Billy Graham because, well, because his skin is colored black. And that's essential in the age of high political correctness. The men of the Illuminati want a black man to replace Billy Graham; thus, T.D. Jakes is their ""Egyptian archetype."" ""Reverend"" Jesse Jackson has been pretty well discredited. ""Reverend"" Al Sharpton is talkative and colorful, but is a public image disaster. So, a new black ""Christian"" leader is desperately needed to fulfill the goals of the elite in the days ahead. Enter Bishop T.D. Jakes!??Moreover, Jakes is not only politically correct, he's an articulate black man with a popular message and style that appeals to all races, not just Afro-Americans. Time magazine describes Jakes' preaching style as ""Oprah in a pulpit.""??Jakes—The Chosen?Confirming my prediction that Jakes is the Illuminati's chosen 21st Century preacher-icon, Time magazine pictured the Bishop on its September 17, 2001 issue, with the headline, ""Is this man THE NEXT BILLY GRAHAM?""??Inside, in the feature article, Time's writers practically slobbered at the mouth in praise of the charismatic Pentecostal preacher. They pictured him symbolically holding a white dove in his hands. They said he is a ""prodigy,"" raved about his ""overwhelming gift,"" and touted his talent as ""colossal.""??Time magazine, a premier Illuminati publication, even compared Jakes' voice to the ""purr of Isaac Hayes"" and to ""the screams of (voodoo-music man) Jay Hawkins.""??T.D. Jakes?This Time magazine photo of a somber Bishop T.D. Jakes with dove is packed with symbolic significance.??Time crowed that Jakes is ""anointed,"" that ""he's got a special trust."" The magazine's editor also noted the Bishop's friendship with celebrities like singer Natalie Cole and ex-pro football star, Deion Sanders. Yep, Bishop T.D. Jakes fits the Billy Graham mold to a tee!??The Time article was followed by yet another favorable CNN Larry King interview, a spot on TV's Good Morning America, and Presto!—the Illuminati now has their new Billy Graham—a politically correct black man they can rely on to keep both the white religious right and the black church crowd alike on the right channel and track—heading blissfully, with whoops and hollers, straight toward Revelation oblivion.??An Occultic, Cabalistic Masterpiece?Oh, I forgot to mention: Time magazine's cover art of Jakes was an occultic, cabalistic masterpiece. An Illuminati jewel. Not only is Jakes shown holding a Bible, it appears he has a red horn protruding out of the top of his head (the little horn of Daniel, the antichrist?) Right above that is a square red dot, which, in occult language, indicates the four corners of the Earth, with these two words to the right of it: ""Venus Rules!"" Venus, of course, in the Illuminist and satanic lexicon, stands for ""Mystery Babylon.""??Wanted: A New Pope to Stand Beside Bishop Jakes?So, Bishop T.D. Jakes is in. We have our new Billy Graham. Now, the Illuminati are on the lookout for a replacement for their other main religious puppet, their fading Catholic servant, Pope John Paul II. And I know exactly who they've got in mind for that job, too. Stay tuned: we'll be examining The Next Pope, The Last Pope in a future issue of Power of Prophecy."

Many hope for a cure and many ask that they be allowed to touch even the hem of his garments for they believed that even this would cure them.??Reading 1 1 KGS 8:1-7, 9-13??The elders of Israel and all the leaders of the tribes,?the princes in the ancestral houses of the children of Israel,?came to King Solomon in Jerusalem,?to bring up the ark of the LORD’s covenant?from the City of David, which is Zion.?All the people of Israel assembled before King Solomon?during the festival in the month of Ethanim (the seventh month).?When all the elders of Israel had arrived,?the priests took up the ark;?they carried the ark of the LORD?and the meeting tent with all the sacred vessels?that were in the tent.?(The priests and Levites carried them.)??King Solomon and the entire community of Israel?present for the occasion?sacrificed before the ark sheep and oxen?too many to number or count.?The priests brought the ark of the covenant of the LORD?to its place beneath the wings of the cherubim in the sanctuary,?the holy of holies of the temple.?The cherubim had their wings spread out over the place of the ark,?sheltering the ark and its poles from above.?There was nothing in the ark but the two stone tablets?which Moses had put there at Horeb,?when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel?at their departure from the land of Egypt.??When the priests left the holy place,?the cloud filled the temple of the LORD?so that the priests could no longer minister because of the cloud,?since the LORD’s glory had filled the temple of the LORD.?Then Solomon said, “The LORD intends to dwell in the dark cloud;?I have truly built you a princely house,?a dwelling where you may abide forever.”?Responsorial Psalm PS 132:6-7, 8-10??R. (8a) Lord, go up to the place of your rest!?Behold, we heard of it in Ephrathah;?we found it in the fields of Jaar.?Let us enter into his dwelling,?let us worship at his footstool.?R. Lord, go up to the place of your rest!?Advance, O LORD, to your resting place,?you and the ark of your majesty.?May your priests be clothed with justice;?let your faithful ones shout merrily for joy.?For the sake of David your servant,?reject not the plea of your anointed.?R. Lord, go up to the place of your rest!?Gospel MK 6:53-56??After making the crossing to the other side of the sea,?Jesus and his disciples came to land at Gennesaret?and tied up there.?As they were leaving the boat, people immediately recognized him.?They scurried about the surrounding country ?and began to bring in the sick on mats?to wherever they heard he was.?Whatever villages or towns or countryside he entered,?they laid the sick in the marketplaces?and begged him that they might touch only the tassel on his cloak;?and as many as touched it were healed.??A Chapter a Day:   1 Timothy 1??1st Epistle to Timothy?1 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the commandment of God our Saviour, and of Christ Jesus our hope:??2 To Timothy, his beloved son in faith. Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father, and from Christ Jesus our Lord.??3 As I desired thee to remain at Ephesus when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some not to teach otherwise,??4 Not to give heed to fables and endless genealogies: which furnish questions rather than the edification of God, which is in faith.??5 Now the end of the commandment is charity, from a pure heart, and a good conscience, and an unfeigned faith.??6 From which things some going astray, are turned aside unto vain babbling:??7 Desiring to be teachers of the law, understanding neither the things they say, nor whereof they affirm.??8 But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully:??9 Knowing this, that the law is not made for the just man, but for the unjust and disobedient, for the ungodly, and for sinners, for the wicked and defiled, for murderers of fathers, and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,??10 For fornicators, for them who defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and whatever other thing is contrary to sound doctrine,??11 Which is according to the gospel of the glory of the blessed God, which hath been committed to my trust.??12 I give thanks who hath strengthened me, even to Christ Jesus our Lord, for that he hath counted me faithful, putting me in the ministry;??13 Who before was a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and contumelious. But I obtained the mercy of God, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.??14 Now the grace of our Lord hath abounded exceedingly with faith and love, which is in Christ Jesus.??15 A faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into this world to save sinners, of whom I am the chief.??16 But for this cause have I obtained mercy: that in me first Christ Jesus might shew forth all patience, for the information of them that shall believe in him unto life everlasting.??17 Now to the king of ages, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.??18 This precept I commend to thee, O son Timothy; according to the prophecies going before on thee, that thou war in them a good warfare,??19 Having faith and a good conscience, which some rejecting have made shipwreck concerning the faith.??20 Of whom is Hymeneus and Alexander, whom I have delivered up to Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.??Monday, February 10, 2014?St. Scholastica?(480-542?)??Twins often share the same interests and ideas with an equal intensity. Therefore, it is no surprise that Scholastica and her twin brother, Benedict (July 11), established religious communities within a few miles from each other.?Born in 480 of wealthy parents, Scholastica and Benedict were brought up together until he left central Italy for Rome to continue his studies.??Little is known of Scholastica’s early life. She founded a religious community for women near Monte Cassino at Plombariola, five miles from where her brother governed a monastery.??The twins visited each other once a year in a farmhouse because Scholastica was not permitted inside the monastery. They spent these times discussing spiritual matters.??According to the Dialogues of St. Gregory the Great, the brother and sister spent their last day together in prayer and conversation. Scholastica sensed her death was close at hand and she begged Benedict to stay with her until the next day.??He refused her request because he did not want to spend a night outside the monastery, thus breaking his own Rule. Scholastica asked God to let her brother remain and a severe thunderstorm broke out, preventing Benedict and his monks from returning to the abbey.??Benedict cried out, “God forgive you, Sister. What have you done?” Scholastica replied, “I asked a favor of you and you refused. I asked it of God and he granted it.”??Brother and sister parted the next morning after their long discussion. Three days later, Benedict was praying in his monastery and saw the soul of his sister rising heavenward in the form of a white dove. Benedict then announced the death of his sister to the monks and later buried her in the tomb he had prepared for himself.??Comment:??Scholastica and Benedict gave themselves totally to God and gave top priority to deepening their friendship with him through prayer. They sacrificed some of the opportunities they would have had to be together as brother and sister in order better to fulfill their vocation to the religious life. In coming closer to Christ, however, they found they were also closer to each other. In joining a religious community, they did not forget or forsake their family but rather found more brothers and sisters.??Quote:??“All religious are under an obligation, in accordance with the particular vocation of each, to work zealously and diligently for the building up and growth of the whole mystical body of Christ and for the good of the particular churches. It is their duty to foster these objectives primarily by means of prayer, works of penance, and by the example of their own lives” (Vatican II, Decree on the Pastoral Office of Bishops, 33, Austin Flannery translation).??Patron Saint of:??Nuns"

The young prophet did not eat or drink anything on his journey there nor was he supposed to do so before he made it back to Judah.

If I ever teach or write something which isn't true to GOD's word than I want to be called out on it. I never want to lead anyone astray.

17104205,1,"ST SCHOLASTICA, VIRGIN?Feast: February 10??From St. Gregory the Great, Dial. l.2, c. 33 and 34. About the year 543.?This saint was sister to the great St. Benedict. She consecrated herself to God from her earliest youth, as St. Gregory testifies. Where her first monastery was situated is not mentioned; but after her brother removed to Mount Cassino she chose her retreat at Plombariola, in that neighbourhood, where she founded and governed a nunnery about five miles distant to the south from St. Benedict's monastery. St. Bertharius, who was Abbot of Cassino three hundred years after, says that she instructed in virtue several of her own sex. And whereas St. Gregory informs us that St. Benedict governed nuns as well as monks, his sister must have been their abbess under his rule and direction. She visited her holy brother once a year, and as she was not allowed to enter his monastery, he went out with some of his monks to meet her at a house at some small distance. They spent these visits in the praises of God, and in conferring together on spiritual matters. St. Gregory relates a remarkable circumstance of the I last of these visits. Scholastica having passed the day as usual in singing psalms and pious discourse, they sat down in the evening to take their refection. After it was over, Scholastica, perhaps foreknowing it would be their last interview in this world, or at least desirous of some further spiritual improvement, was very urgent with her brother to delay his return till the next day, that they might entertain themselves till morning upon the happiness of the other life. St. Benedict, unwilling to transgress his rule, told her he could not pass a night out of his monastery, so desired her not to insist upon such a breach of monastic discipline. Scholastica finding him resolved on going home, laying her hands joined upon the table, and her head upon them, with many tears, begged of Almighty God to interpose in her behalf. Her prayer was scarce ended when there happened such a storm of rain, thunder, and lightning, that neither St. Benedict nor any of his companions could set a foot out of doors. He complained to his sister, saying, ""God forgive you, sister; what have you done?"" She answered, ""I asked you a favour, and you refused it me; I asked it of Almighty God, and he has granted it me."" St. Benedict was therefore obliged to comply with her request, and they spent the night in conferences on pious subjects, chiefly on the felicity of the blessed, to which both most ardently aspired, and which she was shortly to enjoy. The next morning they parted, and three days after St. Scholastica died in her solitude. St. Benedict was then alone in contemplation on Mount Cassino, and lifting up his eyes to heaven, he saw the soul of his sister ascending thither in the shape of a dove. Filled with joy at her happy passage, he gave thanks for it to God, and declared her death to his brethren, some of whom he sent to bring her corpse to his monastery, where he caused it to be laid in the tomb which he had prepared for himself. She must have died about the year 543. Her relics are said to have been translated into France, together with those of St. Bennet, in the seventh century, according to the relation given by the monk Adrevald.1 They are said to have been deposited at Mans, and kept in the collegiate church of St. Peter in that city, in a rich silver shrine. In 1562 this shrine was preserved from being plundered by the Huguenots as is related by Chatelain. Her principal festival at Mans is kept a holyday on the 11th of July, the day of the translation of her relics. She was honored in some places with an office of three lessons, in the time of St. Louis, as appears from a calendar of Longchamp written in his reign.?Louis of Granada, treating on the perfection of the love of God, mentions the miraculous storm obtained by St. Scholastica to show with what excess of goodness God is always ready to hear the petitions and desires of his servants. This pious soul must have received strong pledges and most sensible tokens of his love, seeing she depended on receiving so readily what she asked of him. No child could address himself with so great confidence to his most tender parent. The love which God bears us, and his readiness to succour and comfort us, if we humbly confess and lay before him our wants, infinitely surpasses all that can be found in creatures. Nor can we be surprised that he so easily heard the prayer of this holy virgin, since at the command of Joshua he stopped the heavens, God obeying the voice of man! He hears the most secret desires of those that fear and love him, and does their will: if he sometimes seems deaf to their cries, it is to grant their main desire by doing what is most expedient for them, as St. Austin frequently observes. The short prayer by which St. Scholastica gained this remarkable victory over her brother, who was one of the greatest saints on earth, was doubtless no more than a single act of her pure desires, which she continually turned toward, and fixed on her beloved. It was enough for her to cast her eyes interiorly upon him with whom she was closely and inseparably united in mind and affections, to move him so suddenly to change the course of the elements in order to satisfy her pious desire. By placing herself, as a docile scholar, continually at the feet of the Divine Majesty, who filled all the powers of her soul with the sweetness of his heavenly communications, she learned that sublime science of perfection in which she became a mistress to so many other chaste souls by this divine exercise.

17104172,1,"ST SCHOLASTICA, VIRGIN?Feast: February 10??From St. Gregory the Great, Dial. l.2, c. 33 and 34. About the year 543.?This saint was sister to the great St. Benedict. She consecrated herself to God from her earliest youth, as St. Gregory testifies. Where her first monastery was situated is not mentioned; but after her brother removed to Mount Cassino she chose her retreat at Plombariola, in that neighbourhood, where she founded and governed a nunnery about five miles distant to the south from St. Benedict's monastery. St. Bertharius, who was Abbot of Cassino three hundred years after, says that she instructed in virtue several of her own sex. And whereas St. Gregory informs us that St. Benedict governed nuns as well as monks, his sister must have been their abbess under his rule and direction. She visited her holy brother once a year, and as she was not allowed to enter his monastery, he went out with some of his monks to meet her at a house at some small distance. They spent these visits in the praises of God, and in conferring together on spiritual matters. St. Gregory relates a remarkable circumstance of the I last of these visits. Scholastica having passed the day as usual in singing psalms and pious discourse, they sat down in the evening to take their refection. After it was over, Scholastica, perhaps foreknowing it would be their last interview in this world, or at least desirous of some further spiritual improvement, was very urgent with her brother to delay his return till the next day, that they might entertain themselves till morning upon the happiness of the other life. St. Benedict, unwilling to transgress his rule, told her he could not pass a night out of his monastery, so desired her not to insist upon such a breach of monastic discipline. Scholastica finding him resolved on going home, laying her hands joined upon the table, and her head upon them, with many tears, begged of Almighty God to interpose in her behalf. Her prayer was scarce ended when there happened such a storm of rain, thunder, and lightning, that neither St. Benedict nor any of his companions could set a foot out of doors. He complained to his sister, saying, ""God forgive you, sister; what have you done?"" She answered, ""I asked you a favour, and you refused it me; I asked it of Almighty God, and he has granted it me."" St. Benedict was therefore obliged to comply with her request, and they spent the night in conferences on pious subjects, chiefly on the felicity of the blessed, to which both most ardently aspired, and which she was shortly to enjoy. The next morning they parted, and three days after St. Scholastica died in her solitude. St. Benedict was then alone in contemplation on Mount Cassino, and lifting up his eyes to heaven, he saw the soul of his sister ascending thither in the shape of a dove. Filled with joy at her happy passage, he gave thanks for it to God, and declared her death to his brethren, some of whom he sent to bring her corpse to his monastery, where he caused it to be laid in the tomb which he had prepared for himself. She must have died about the year 543. Her relics are said to have been translated into France, together with those of St. Bennet, in the seventh century, according to the relation given by the monk Adrevald.1 They are said to have been deposited at Mans, and kept in the collegiate church of St. Peter in that city, in a rich silver shrine. In 1562 this shrine was preserved from being plundered by the Huguenots as is related by Chatelain. Her principal festival at Mans is kept a holyday on the 11th of July, the day of the translation of her relics. She was honored in some places with an office of three lessons, in the time of St. Louis, as appears from a calendar of Longchamp written in his reign.?Louis of Granada, treating on the perfection of the love of God, mentions the miraculous storm obtained by St. Scholastica to show with what excess of goodness God is always ready to hear the petitions and desires of his servants. This pious soul must have received strong pledges and most sensible tokens of his love, seeing she depended on receiving so readily what she asked of him. No child could address himself with so great confidence to his most tender parent. The love which God bears us, and his readiness to succour and comfort us, if we humbly confess and lay before him our wants, infinitely surpasses all that can be found in creatures. Nor can we be surprised that he so easily heard the prayer of this holy virgin, since at the command of Joshua he stopped the heavens, God obeying the voice of man! He hears the most secret desires of those that fear and love him, and does their will: if he sometimes seems deaf to their cries, it is to grant their main desire by doing what is most expedient for them, as St. Austin frequently observes. The short prayer by which St. Scholastica gained this remarkable victory over her brother, who was one of the greatest saints on earth, was doubtless no more than a single act of her pure desires, which she continually turned toward, and fixed on her beloved. It was enough for her to cast her eyes interiorly upon him with whom she was closely and inseparably united in mind and affections, to move him so suddenly to change the course of the elements in order to satisfy her pious desire. By placing herself, as a docile scholar, continually at the feet of the Divine Majesty, who filled all the powers of her soul with the sweetness of his heavenly communications, she learned that sublime science of perfection in which she became a mistress to so many other chaste souls by this divine exercise. Her life in her retirement, to that happy moment which closed her mortal pilgrimage, was a continued uniform contemplation, by which all her powers were united to and transformed into God.?(Taken from Vol. I of ""The Lives or the Fathers, Martyrs and Other Principal Saints"" by the Rev.

They spent these times discussing spiritual matters.??According to the Dialogues of St. Gregory the Great, the brother and sister spent their last day together in prayer and conversation. Scholastica sensed her death was close at hand and she begged Benedict to stay with her until the next day.??He refused her request because he did not want to spend a night outside the monastery, thus breaking his own Rule. Scholastica asked God to let her brother remain and a severe thunderstorm broke out, preventing Benedict and his monks from returning to the abbey.??Benedict cried out, “God forgive you, Sister. What have you done?” Scholastica replied, “I asked a favor of you and you refused. I asked it of God and he granted it.”??Brother and sister parted the next morning after their long discussion. Three days later, Benedict was praying in his monastery and saw the soul of his sister rising heavenward in the form of a white dove.

What I would like us to notice about these verses is that the wilderness and temptation experience took place immediately after Jesus experienced a spiritually high time being baptized by John.  The scripture tells us, directly after Jesus came out of the water from baptism the Holy Spirit descended upon him in the form of a dove and our heavenly Father declared, “You are my beloved son; in You I am well pleased.” Immediately following this awesome experience, Luke declares, “Then Jesus, being filled with the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, being tempted for forty days by the devil . . .”??Isn’t it amazing that right after experiencing a wonderful move of God from worship on sunday or an encounter with God during the week, a wilderness is right there waiting on you?  Have you ever experienced the awesome highs and euphoria of being in God’s presence one moment, only to be brought crashing down by some trouble waiting to ponce on you immediately after?  If this is your testimony, have no fear.  Even this is for your good.??We must know that in this life we can not, and will not, stay in a state paradise.  God Allows us to experience a “foretaste” of His glory here on earth.  But we must remember that God also allows the Holy Spirit to lead us into the wilderness.  The wilderness is there to strengthen us for the journey ahead.  The wilderness prepares us for the work of ministry God is calling us to.  The wilderness also test and tries our faithfulness to God.  Every Christian has a wilderness waiting to test their faith and faithfulness.  So do not fear.  Don’t think it strange when your wilderness comes after some great high experience.  Trust God, stay faithful, and follow the Holy Spirit, INTO THE WILDERNESS.  Blessings my fb family."

On his last visit, after a day passed in spiritual converse, the Saint, knowing that her end was near, said, ""My brother, leave me not, I pray you, this night, but discourse with me till dawn on the bliss of those who see God in heaven."" St. Benedict would not, break his rule at the bidding of natural affection; and then the Saint bowed her head on her hands and prayed; and there arose a storm so violent that St. Benedict could not return to his monastery, and they passed the night in heavenly conversation.          ?Three days later St. Benedict saw in a vision the soul of his sister going up in the likeness of a dove into heaven. Then he gave thanks to God for the graces He had given her, and for the glory which had crowned them. When she died, St. Benedict, her spiritual daughters, and the monks sent by St. Benedict mingled their tears and prayed, ""Alas! alas! dearest mother, to whom dost thou leave us now? Pray for us to Jesus, to Whom thou art gone."" They then devoutly celebrated holy Mass, ""commending her soul to God;"" and her body was borne to Monte Casino, and laid by her brother in the tomb he had prepared for himself."" And they bewailed her many days;"" and St. Benedict said, ""Weep not, sisters and brothers; for assuredly Jesus has taken her before us to be our aid and defence against all our enemies, that we may stand in the evil day and be in all things perfect.""          ?She died about the year 543.

17103266,1,"Monday, February 10?Memorial of Scholastica, virgin, religious?Make every visitation sacred?Once a year Saint Scholastica and her equally busy brother, Saint Benedict, would pause to visit each other for a day. At one of these meetings Scholastica wanted Benedict to linger on but he insisted on going. Tradition has it that Scholastica prayed that God hear the request her brother was ignoring, and a furious storm came up, forcing him to stay longer. Back home three days later, Benedict saw his sister’s soul leaving the earth and ascending to heaven in the form of a shining white dove. Cherish each visit with a loved one as if it were your last.?Today’s readings: 1 Kings 8:1-7, 9-13; Mark 6:53-56 (329). “They . . . began to bring in the sick on mats to wherever they heard he was.”"
17103265,1,"Mark 1 ??New International Version (NIV)?? ?John the Baptist Prepares the Way??1 The beginning of the good news about Jesus the Messiah,[a] the Son of God,[b] 2 as it is written in Isaiah the prophet:??“I will send my messenger ahead of you,?    who will prepare your way”[c]—?3 “a voice of one calling in the wilderness,?‘Prepare the way for the Lord,?    make straight paths for him.’”[d]? ?4 And so John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. 5 The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him. Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River. 6 John wore clothing made of camel’s hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey. 7 And this was his message: “After me comes the one more powerful than I, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie. 8 I baptize you with[e] water, but he will baptize you with[f] the Holy Spirit.”? ?The Baptism and Testing of Jesus??9 At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. 10 Just as Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. 11 And a voice came from heaven: “You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased.”? ?12 At once the Spirit sent him out into the wilderness, 13 and he was in the wilderness forty days, being tempted[g] by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and angels attended him.? ?Jesus Announces the Good News??14 After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God. 15 “The time has come,” he said. “The kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!”? ?Jesus Calls His First Disciples??16 As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen. 17 “Come, follow me,” Jesus said, “and I will send you out to fish for people.” 18 At once they left their nets and followed him.? ?19 When he had gone a little farther, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John in a boat, preparing their nets. 20 Without delay he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.? ?Jesus Drives Out an Impure Spirit??21 They went to Capernaum, and when the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach. 22 The people were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, not as the teachers of the law. 23 Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an impure spirit cried out, 24 “What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!”? ?25 “Be quiet!” said Jesus sternly. “Come out of him!” 26 The impure spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek.? ?27 The people were all so amazed that they asked each other, “What is this? A new teaching—and with authority! He even gives orders to impure spirits and they obey him.” 28 News about him spread quickly over the whole region of Galilee.? ?Jesus Heals Many??29 As soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew. 30 Simon’s mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they immediately told Jesus about her. 31 So he went to her, took her hand and helped her up. The fever left her and she began to wait on them.? ?32 That evening after sunset the people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed. 33 The whole town gathered at the door, 34 and Jesus healed many who had various diseases. He also drove out many demons, but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was.? ?Jesus Prays in a Solitary Place??35 Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed. 36 Simon and his companions went to look for him, 37 and when they found him, they exclaimed: “Everyone is looking for you!”? ?38 Jesus replied, “Let us go somewhere else—to the nearby villages—so I can preach there also. That is why I have come.” 39 So he traveled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.? ?Jesus Heals a Man With Leprosy??40 A man with leprosy[h] came to him and begged him on his knees, “If you are willing, you can make me clean.”? ?41 Jesus was indignant.[i] He reached out his hand and touched the man. “I am willing,” he said. “Be clean!” 42 Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cleansed.? ?43 Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning: 44 “See that you don’t tell this to anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.” 45 Instead he went out and began to talk freely, spreading the news. As a result, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places. Yet the people still came to him from everywhere.??Footnotes:?a.Mark 1:1 Or Jesus Christ. Messiah (Hebrew) and Christ (Greek) both mean Anointed One.?b.Mark 1:1 Some manuscripts do not have the Son of God.?c.Mark 1:2 Mal. 3:1?d.Mark 1:3 Isaiah 40:3?e.Mark 1:8 Or in?f.Mark 1:8 Or in?g.Mark 1:13 The Greek for tempted can also mean tested.?h.Mark 1:40 The Greek word traditionally translated leprosy was used for various diseases affecting the skin.?i.Mark 1:41 Many manuscripts Jesus was filled with compassion"

17102925,1,"St. Scholastica?St. Scholastica, like her brother, dedicated herself to God from early youth. Information on the virgin Scholastica is very scanty. In his Second Book of Dialogues (Ch. 33 and 34) Pope St. Gregory has described for us the last meeting between brother and sister:??""His sister Scholastica, who had been consecrated to God in early childhood, used to visit with him once a year. On these occasions he would go to meet her in a house belonging to the monastery a short distance from the entrance. For this particular visit he joined her there with a few of his disciples and they spent the whole day singing God's praises and conversing about the spiritual life.??""When darkness was setting in they took their meal together and continued their conversation at table until it was quite late. Then the holy nun said to him, 'Please do not leave me tonight, brother. Let us keep on talking about the joys of heaven till morning.' 'What are you saying, sister?' he replied. 'You know that I cannot stay away from the monastery.' The sky was so clear at the time, there was not a cloud in sight.??""At her brother's refusal Scholastica folded her hands on the table and rested her head upon them in earnest prayer. When she looked up again, there was a sudden burst of lightning and thunder accompanied by such a downpour that Benedict and his companions were unable to set foot outside the door. By shedding a flood of tears while she prayed, this holy nun had darkened the cloudless sky with a heavy rain. The storm began as soon as her prayer was over. In fact, the two coincided so closely that the thunder was already resounding as she raised her head from the table. The very instant she ended her prayer the rain poured down.??""Realizing that he could not return to the abbey in this terrible storm, Benedict complained bitterly. 'God forgive you, sister!' he said. 'What have you done?' Scholastica simply answered, 'When I appealed to you, you would not listen to me. So I turned to my God and He heard my prayer. Leave now if you can. Leave me here and go back to your monastery.'??""This, of course, he could not do. He had no choice now but to stay, in spite of his unwillingness. They spent the entire night together and both of them derived great profit from the holy thoughts they exchanged about the interior life. The next morning Scholastica returned to her convent and Benedict to his monastery.??""Three days later as he stood in his room looking up toward the sky, he beheld his sister's soul leaving her body and entering the heavenly court in the form of a dove. Overjoyed at her eternal glory, he gave thanks to God in hymns of praise. Then, after informing his brethren of her death, he sent some of them to bring her body to the abbey and bury it in the tomb he had prepared for himself. The bodies of these two were now to share a common resting place, just as in life their souls had always been one in God.""??Her tomb is at Monte Cassino."
17102915,1,"WHEN MEMORIES BECOME HISTORY...??On a serious note, my wife must not read this! This is a confession to a bottled up feelings. For nearly twenty years, I have struggled with this constricted burden. And pardon me to extricate this once and for all.??It began on the first day in primary five and since then, the attraction had remained perpetually glued. She became my first crush and confidante. Innocently, we shared childhood fantasies and dreamt of a life together. But we were perilously too naïve to make our wish a reality.??I watched her grow to a beautiful woman. Her beauty was the gossip of her contemporaries while boys day dream about her endowment. Just as nature showered her with good look so were her inner thoughts. She had the gentility of a dove and the respect of an ostrich. Rather than placing her on the wings of the peacock, she exemplified domesticated respect for both teachers and students. To cap it all, she was academically intelligent.??While everyone benefited from her bountiful beauty, I suffered untold persecutions from teachers and senior students who were dangerously obsessed with her. For nearly six years, I received needless beatings and unwarranted punishments. It was later I learnt the reasons for my punishments. Infuriated by their inability to win her heart, they turned their anger on me; for she would always tell them I was her boyfriend!??Plenty opportunities cropped up for me to be the man and tell her how wonderful she was and how fulfilled it would be to have her as a soul mate, alas! The devil in me was so timid that I was always tongue tied.??Helplessly, I endured the torture of naivety as I watched her grow into a blossom flowers. Her presence was my joy and to be fair to her, she was always around me playing the discreet role of a mother. She is usually the first to tell me a wrong dressing and to thumb me up for an immaculate outing. ??This may sound odd, but she was the reason I took my studies seriously. I didn't want any guy to beat me in class so that her attention wouldn't be shifted to them. She was my motivation.??Valentine days like this reminds me of her value and magic. While I struggled to buy ordinary card for her, she bombarded me with assorted gifts. She always had loads of them, because guys would outdo themselves to shower her with gifts. And trust her, half of the present always find their ways to me where the assemblage of my friends would hover around to do justice to the valentine largesse. (I'm sure Saint Musa, Edego Ibrahim Ismail and co would be giggling in childhood memories).??For six years I watched her grow, for six years I fantasized a future with her. For six years we shared the same seat in class and for six years I couldn't tell her my feelings! Indeed, one should never befriend the woman he loves.??Wherever she is now I don't know, she went out of my radar after years of ineptitude. No doubt, she is now married, for a lady like her can't wait too long without having a man to house her. She was what the conservative would called 'wife material’.??Wherever you are my childhood dream, I beg for your pardon. I crave for your understanding. I did what I did because I was naïve and inexperienced. I spent all the time protecting you, forgetting that you don't befriend the woman you love.??Wherever you are, find time to reflect on these lines and know that I wasn’t a weakling but a gentle page boy waiting on nature to determine my ripeness…??***The ghost of my yesterday keeps haunting me,? Endlessly as I struggle in mitigated perspiration? To erase the memories of you.? Every echo reminds me of your suppressed giggles,? As they flutters like butterflies.??Some pasts are better not lived? As they become a nagging stare to the present? Show me a man without a past? And I will withdraw from the anguish of my yesterday? Destiny and time conspired? To create two separate abodes for its inhabitants? But the pulse of love?Refused the limitations of fate.??Do I continue in endless anguish? Or resign to the flap of fate?? Call me a weak soul? You are not wrong,? Push me to extinction? You are on point? Fade away from my existence? You are justified.??But beyond the euphoria? Of your conquest,? Know it that,? I once danced to your whispers? I once ran your race.? Even as you swim on your tide? Of bliss??Remember there once? Lived a Lily livered boy? Whose passion was a distant dream? The dream may be dead? But like a running stream?Cascading the belly of the land? I still smell your breath? And still dance to your suppressed?

17102764,1,"Monday, February 10, 2014?St. Scholastica?(480-542?)??Twins often share the same interests and ideas with an equal intensity. Therefore, it is no surprise that Scholastica and her twin brother, Benedict (July 11), established religious communities within a few miles from each other.?Born in 480 of wealthy parents, Scholastica and Benedict were brought up together until he left central Italy for Rome to continue his studies.??Little is known of Scholastica’s early life. She founded a religious community for women near Monte Cassino at Plombariola, five miles from where her brother governed a monastery.??The twins visited each other once a year in a farmhouse because Scholastica was not permitted inside the monastery. They spent these times discussing spiritual matters.??According to the Dialogues of St. Gregory the Great, the brother and sister spent their last day together in prayer and conversation. Scholastica sensed her death was close at hand and she begged Benedict to stay with her until the next day.??He refused her request because he did not want to spend a night outside the monastery, thus breaking his own Rule. Scholastica asked God to let her brother remain and a severe thunderstorm broke out, preventing Benedict and his monks from returning to the abbey.??Benedict cried out, “God forgive you, Sister. What have you done?” Scholastica replied, “I asked a favor of you and you refused. I asked it of God and he granted it.”??Brother and sister parted the next morning after their long discussion. Three days later, Benedict was praying in his monastery and saw the soul of his sister rising heavenward in the form of a white dove. Benedict then announced the death of his sister to the monks and later buried her in the tomb he had prepared for himself.??COMMENT:?Scholastica and Benedict gave themselves totally to God and gave top priority to deepening their friendship with him through prayer. They sacrificed some of the opportunities they would have had to be together as brother and sister in order better to fulfill their vocation to the religious life. In coming closer to Christ, however, they found they were also closer to each other. In joining a religious community, they did not forget or forsake their family but rather found more brothers and sisters.??QUOTE:?“All religious are under an obligation, in accordance with the particular vocation of each, to work zealously and diligently for the building up and growth of the whole mystical body of Christ and for the good of the particular churches. It is their duty to foster these objectives primarily by means of prayer, works of penance, and by the example of their own lives” (Vatican II, Decree on the Pastoral Office of Bishops, 33, Austin Flannery translation)."

17102201,1,"Thank  you Jesus!??17. Catalina Rivas: A Testimony on the Holy Mass?18. ??19. In 1993, Catalina Rivas, a housewife and grandmother from Cochabamba, Bolivia began receiving messages from Jesus and Mary. Catalina bears the stigmata, the suffering wounds of Christ’s crucifixion. Amazingly, Catalina, who did not finish high school, has written eight books containing the messages of Jesus and Mary – all without a single theological mistake, and all given an imprimatur by the Archbishop of Cochabamba. ?20. Dr. Ricardo Castanon, a doctor who had tested Catalina Rivas a number of times, has this to say about her: ?21. Catalina Rivas did not finish high school yet in less than three years she has written eight books. In two weeks, she had written by hand 900 pages. The content talks about theology, sociology, the human life and Divine Spirituality. When you see that she doesn’t have the background, she has never written anything and then she comes with notebooks of 200, 300, 400 pages and there is no theological mistake, you know something special is happening. Catalina Rivas says when Jesus dictates to her, her heart begins to beat very fast during this time…?22. In the spring of 1999, Fox TV Network investigated the events in Cochabamba, including a bleeding statue of Christ, and found astonishing results from independent medical testing of Catalina Rivas concerning her claims of mystical experiences. Fox Network aired its findings in a 2-hour, prime time TV documentary entitled “Signs from God – Science Tests Faith” that was viewed by an estimated 27 million people. ?23. Excerpts of beautiful messages of Jesus and Mary to Catalina Rivas are published below. Do open your heart to the inspirations of the Holy Spirit and you will be blessed with a renewed love and appreciation for the greatest treasure on earth: the Holy Mass. ?24. Living Out the Word of God?25. When I arrived in Church the next day, a little bit late, His Excellency, the Archbishop and the priests were already coming out of the sacristy. With that gentle and feminine voice that sweetens one’s soul, the Virgin Mary said: ?26. Why must you all arrive at the last moment? You should arrive earlier so that you can say a prayer and ask the Lord to send His Holy Spirit, that the Holy Spirit may grant you a spirit of peace and cleanse you of the spirit of the world, your worries, your problems and your distractions in order that you may be able to live this so sacred a moment… ?27. I want you to be attentive to the readings and to the entire homily of the priest. Remember that the Bible says that the Word of God does not return without having borne fruit. If you are attentive, something of all that you have heard will remain in you. You must try to recall all day long those words that have left an impression on you… Savor them for the rest of the day and this will then become part of you, because that is the way to change one’s life, by allowing the Word of God to transform you.?28. …I asked God to forgive me for having had so hard a heart for so many years, and for having taught my children that they should go to Mass on Sunday (only) because it was so commanded by the Church and not for love, for the need to be filled by God… For I, who had attended so many Eucharistic Celebrations, mostly to fulfill an obligation, and thus believed that I was saved, the thought of living the celebration had never entered my mind, much less that of paying attention to the readings or to the priest’s homily! ??29. On the Offertory?30. Our Mother said, “Observe. They are the guardian angels of each one of the persons who are here. This is the moment in which your guardian angel carries your offerings and petitions before the altar of the Lord.” ?31. At that point I was completely astonished because these beings had such beautiful faces, so radiant as one is unable to imagine… Their naked feet did not touch the floor, but rather they went as if gliding. The procession was very beautiful. ?32. Some of them were carrying something like a golden bowl with something (inside) that shone a great deal with a golden white light. The Virgin Mary said: ?33. Observe. They are the guardian angels of the people who are offering this Holy Mass for many intentions; those who are conscious of the significance of this celebration, those who have something to offer to the Lord… ?34. Make your offerings at this moment… Offer up your sorrows, your pains, your dreams, your sadness, your joys… your petitions. Remember that the Mass has infinite value. Therefore be generous in your offering and in your asking.?35. …At the end of the procession came other angels who were rather sad, with their hands together in prayer, but with their eyes downcast. ?36. These are the guardian angels of the people who are here, yet they are not here. That is to say, they are the people… who have come here out of obligation but without any desire to participate in the Holy Mass. Their angels go forth in sadness because they have nothing to carry to the altar…?37. Consecration?38. The final moment of the Preface had arrived, and suddenly when the assembly was saying, “Holy, Holy, Holy” everything that was behind the celebrants disappeared. Behind the left side of the Archbishop appeared thousands of angels in a diagonal line: small angels, large angels, angels with immense wings, angels with small wings, angels with no wings… ?39. Everyone knelt down with hands placed together in prayer and bowed their heads in reverence. You could hear the most beautiful music, as if there were very many choirs harmonizing in different voices, all of them saying in unison with the people: “Holy, Holy, Holy…” ?40. The moment of the Consecration had arrived, the moment of the most marvelous of miracles… Behind the right side of the Archbishop appeared a multitude of people also in a diagonal line… Their faces were also brilliant, full of joy. They all seemed to be of the same age. You could tell… that there were people of different ages but their faces looked the same, without wrinkles, happy. They all knelt down as well, at the singing of the “Holy, Holy, Holy Lord…” ?41. Our Lady said: “These are all the Saints and the Blessed in Heaven, and among them are also the souls of your relatives and family members who already enjoy the presence of God.” ?42. Then I saw her. She was there, exactly to the right of His Excellency, the Archbishop… a step behind the celebrant. She was suspended a little off the floor, kneeling on some very fine fabrics… The Holy Virgin, her hands joined together, was looking attentively and respectfully at the celebrant. And she was speaking to me from there, but silently directly to my heart, without looking at me… ?43. It seems strange to you seeing me a little behind Monsignor, does it not? This is how it should be… Notwithstanding how much My Son loves me, He has not given me the dignity that He gives a priest, of being able to bring Him in my hands daily, as the priestly hands do. Because of this I feel such profound respect for a priest and for the whole miracle that God carries out through a priest, that I am compelled to kneel here.?44. …There began to appear in front of the altar some shadows in human form, gray in color, and they were raising their hands upwards. The Holy Virgin said: ?45. These are the blessed souls of Purgatory who wait for your prayers to be refreshed. Do not stop praying for them. They pray for you but they cannot pray for themselves… ?46. …And to think that there are people, that there are some of us who can be distracted, talking at that moment … I say with sorrow that many men, more than women, stand with their arms crossed, as if paying homage to the Lord from one equal to another.?47. The celebrant said the words of the Consecration. He was a person of normal height but suddenly he began to grow and become filled with light… When he raised the Sacred Form (the Host), I saw his hands. There were some marks on the back of his hands, from which emanated a great deal of light. It was Jesus! …It was He Who was wrapping His Body around the celebrant, as if He were lovingly surrounding the hands of His Excellency. At that moment the Host began to grow and became enormous, and upon it was the marvelous Face of Jesus, looking toward His people. ?48. By instinct I was about to bow my head and Our Lady said: ?49. Do not look down. Look up to view and contemplate Him. Cross your gaze with His and repeat the Fatima prayer: Lord, I believe, I adore, I trust and I love you. I ask pardon for those who do not believe, do not adore, do not trust and do not love you…. Now tell Him how much you love Him and render your homage to the King of Kings.?50. …Immediately afterwards, Monsignor said the consecratory words for the wine and, as the words were being said, lightning began to flash in the sky and in the background. There was no church ceiling and no walls. It was all in darkness, but for that brilliant light on the altar. ?51. Suddenly, I saw Jesus crucified suspended in the air. I saw Him from the head to the lower part of His chest. The cross beam of the cross was sustained by some strong, large hands. From within the resplendent light, a much smaller, brilliant light came forth like that of a very small, very brilliant dove. It swiftly flew once around the entire Church and went to rest on the left shoulder of His Excellency who continued being Jesus, because I could make out His long hair, His luminous wounds and His large body, but I could not see His Face. ?52. Above, was Jesus crucified, His head fallen upon His right shoulder. I was able to contemplate His Face, His bruised arms and torn flesh. He had a wound on the right side of His chest and blood was gushing out toward the left; and what looked like water, but very brilliant, (gushed out) toward the right. They were more like jets of light coming forth towards the faithful, and moving to the right and to the left. I was amazed at the amount of blood that was flowing into the chalice. I thought it would overflow and stain the whole altar, but not a single drop was spilled. ?53. At that moment the Virgin Mary said, “This is the miracle of miracles. I have repeated this to you. Time and space do not exist for the Lord, and at the moment of the Consecration all the assembly is taken to the foot of Calvary at the instant of the crucifixion of Jesus.” ?54. Our Father?55. When we were about to pray the Our Father, the Lord spoke for the first time during the celebration and said: ?56. Wait, I want you to pray with the deepest profundity that you can summon. At this moment I want you to bring to mind that person or persons who have done you the most harm during your life, so that you may embrace them close to your bosom and say to them from your heart: “In the name of Jesus, I forgive you and wish you peace. In the Name of Jesus, I ask for your forgiveness and wish you my peace.?57. Communion?58. …The great moment of the encounter in Holy Communion had arrived. The Lord said to me: “Wait a moment. I want you to observe something…” An interior impulse made me raise my eyes towards the person who was about to receive Communion… ?59. I must explain that this person was one of the ladies from our group who had been unable to go to Confession the previous night and had done so just that morning before Holy Mass. When the priest placed the Sacred Host on her tongue, something like a flash of light, that very golden-white light (that I had seen before) went right through this person’s back first, and then continued to envelop her back, her shoulders and her head. The Lord said: “This is how I am pleased to embrace a soul who comes with a clean heart to receive Me!” ?60. The tone of Jesus’ voice was that of a happy person. ?61. While on my way to receive Communion, Jesus said: ?62. The Last Supper was the moment of the greatest intimacy with My own. During that hour of love I instituted what in the eyes of mankind might be the greatest madness: to make Myself a prisoner of Love. I instituted the Eucharist. I wanted to remain with you until the end of time because My Love could not bear that you, whom I loved more than My life, be left orphans …?63. When I returned to my seat and started to kneel down, the Lord said: “Listen…” And a moment later, I began to hear the prayers of the lady who was seated in front of me and who had just received Communion… “Lord, remember that we are at the end of the month and I do not have the money to pay the rent, the car and the children’s school…etc, etc …” ?64. …Jesus said in a sad tone: “Did you notice? Not once did she tell Me that she loved Me…. Not a single time did she say: ‘Thank You Lord.’ It has been a litany of requests… and almost all of those who come to receive Me are like that.” ?65. After the Mass?66. Jesus asked me to remain with Him a few minutes longer after Mass was over. He said, “Do not run out as soon as Mass is over; stay a moment in My company. Enjoy it and let Me enjoy yours…”"

17102143,1,"Monday, February 10, 2014??St. Scholastica?(480-542?)??Twins often share the same interests and ideas with an equal intensity. Therefore, it is no surprise that Scholastica and her twin brother, Benedict (July 11), established religious communities within a few miles from each other.?Born in 480 of wealthy parents, Scholastica and Benedict were brought up together until he left central Italy for Rome to continue his studies.??Little is known of Scholastica’s early life. She founded a religious community for women near Monte Cassino at Plombariola, five miles from where her brother governed a monastery.??The twins visited each other once a year in a farmhouse because Scholastica was not permitted inside the monastery. They spent these times discussing spiritual matters.??According to the Dialogues of St. Gregory the Great, the brother and sister spent their last day together in prayer and conversation. Scholastica sensed her death was close at hand and she begged Benedict to stay with her until the next day.??He refused her request because he did not want to spend a night outside the monastery, thus breaking his own Rule. Scholastica asked God to let her brother remain and a severe thunderstorm broke out, preventing Benedict and his monks from returning to the abbey.??Benedict cried out, “God forgive you, Sister. What have you done?” Scholastica replied, “I asked a favor of you and you refused. I asked it of God and he granted it.”??Brother and sister parted the next morning after their long discussion. Three days later, Benedict was praying in his monastery and saw the soul of his sister rising heavenward in the form of a white dove. Benedict then announced the death of his sister to the monks and later buried her in the tomb he had prepared for himself.??Comment:?Scholastica and Benedict gave themselves totally to God and gave top priority to deepening their friendship with him through prayer. They sacrificed some of the opportunities they would have had to be together as brother and sister in order better to fulfill their vocation to the religious life. In coming closer to Christ, however, they found they were also closer to each other. In joining a religious community, they did not forget or forsake their family but rather found more brothers and sisters.??Quote:?“All religious are under an obligation, in accordance with the particular vocation of each, to work zealously and diligently for the building up and growth of the whole mystical body of Christ and for the good of the particular churches. It is their duty to foster these objectives primarily by means of prayer, works of penance, and by the example of their own lives” (Vatican II, Decree on the Pastoral Office of Bishops, 33, Austin Flannery translation).??Patron Saint of:?Nuns"

17102085,1,"She who loved more could do more.?(from the books of Dialogues by Saint Gregory the Great, pope)??Scholastica, the sister of Saint Benedict, had been consecrated to God from her earliest years. She was accustomed to visiting her brother once a year. He would come down to meet her at a place on the monastery property, not far outside the gate.??One day she came as usual and her saintly brother went with some of his disciples; they spent the whole day praising God and talking of sacred things. As night fell they had supper together.??Their spiritual conversation went on and the hour grew late. The holy nun said to her brother: “Please do not leave me tonight; let us go on until morning talking about the delights of the spiritual life.” “Sister,” he replied, “what are you saying? I simply cannot stay outside my cell.”??When she heard her brother refuse her request, the holy woman joined her hands on the table, laid her head on them and began to pray. As she raised her head from the table, there were such brilliant flashes of lightning, such great peals of thunder and such a heavy downpour of rain that neither Benedict nor his brethren could stir across the threshold of the place where they had been seated. Sadly he began to complain: “May God forgive you, sister. What have you done?” “Well,” she answered, “I asked you and you would not listen; so I asked my God and he did listen. So now go off, if you can, leave me and return to your monastery.”??Reluctant as he was to stay of his own will, he remained against his will. So it came about that they stayed awake the whole night, engrossed in their conversation about the spiritual life.??It is not surprising that she was more effective than he, since as John says, ""God is love,"" it was absolutely right that she could do more, as she loved more.??Three days later, Benedict was in his cell. Looking up to the sky, he saw his sister’s soul leave her body in the form of a dove, and fly up to the secret places of heaven. Rejoicing in her great glory, he thanked almighty God with hymns and words of praise. He then sent his brethren to bring her body to the monastery and lay it in the tomb he had prepared for himself.??Their minds had always been united in God; their bodies were to share a common grave."

Of this Saint but little is known on earth, save that she was the sister of the great patriarch St. Benedict, and that, under his direction, she founded and governed a numerous community near Monte Casino.??        St. Gregory sums up her life by saying that she devoted herself to God from her childhood, and that her pure soul went to God in the likeness of a dove, as if to show that her life had been enriched with the fullest gifts of the Holy Spirit.??        Her brother was accustomed to visit her every year, for ""she could not be sated or wearied with the words of grace which flowed from his lips."" On his last visit, after a day passed in spiritual converse, the Saint, knowing that her end was near, said, ""My brother, leave me not, I pray you, this night, but discourse with me till dawn on the bliss of those who see God in heaven."" St. Benedict would not, break his rule at the bidding of natural affection; and then the Saint bowed her head on her hands and prayed; and there arose a storm so violent that St. Benedict could not return to his monastery, and they passed the night in heavenly conversation.??        Three days later St. Benedict saw in a vision the soul of his sister going up in the likeness of a dove into heaven. Then he gave thanks to God for the graces He had given her, and for the glory which had crowned them. When she died, St. Benedict, her spiritual daughters, and the monks sent by St. Benedict mingled their tears and prayed, ""Alas! alas! dearest mother, to whom dost thou leave us now? Pray for us to Jesus, to Whom thou art gone."" They then devoutly celebrated holy Mass, ""commending her soul to God;"" and her body was borne to Monte Casino, and laid by her brother in the tomb he had prepared for himself."" And they bewailed her many days;"" and St. Benedict said, ""Weep not, sisters and brothers; for assuredly Jesus has taken her before us to be our aid and defence against all our enemies, that we may stand in the evil day and be in all things perfect.""??

17101165,1,"IS THERE A FAMINE IN THE LAND??We read of the great depression and the poverty that many endured through the years following.  Many  of us grew up during that period of time and remember the lack of the luxuries of  today's society.  Many of us grew up on the farm.  I grew up on the farm in middle Tennessee and I remember well the toil that was put forth in order to eke out a living.  We depended so much on the right conditions of the weather.  Good planting seasons and the right amount of rainfall at the right time would be somewhat assuring of a good crop.  I don't believe that any of us in America have ever experienced a real famine in the land.  Look at 2 Kings 6:25-29     And there was a great famine in Samaria; and indeed they besieged it until a donkey's head was sold for eighty shekels of silver, and one-fourth of a kab of dove droppings for five shekels of silver. [26] Then, as the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried out to him, saying, ""Help, my lord, O king!"" [27] And he said, ""If the Lord does not help you, where can I find help for you? From the threshing floor or from the winepress?"" [28] Then the king said to her, ""What is troubling you?"" And she answered, ""This woman said to me, 'Give your son, that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.' [29] So we boiled my son, and ate him. And I said to her on the next day, 'Give your son, that we may eat him'; but she has hidden her son."" ?This was a real famine in the land.  I believe one can see the extreme effects of a famine of this magnitude.  Even cannibalism is exhibited.??Amos predicts of a famine in the land that will have even more devastating effects.  ?In  Amos 8:11-13    ""Behold, the days are coming,"" says the Lord God, ""That I will send a famine on the land, Not a famine of bread, Nor a thirst for water, But of hearing the words of the Lord.    [12] They shall wander from sea to sea, And from north to east; They shall run to and fro, seeking the word of the Lord, But shall not find it.  [13] ""In that day the fair virgins  And strong young men Shall faint from thirst. ?What could possibly be more devastating than a famine of the Word of God?  That is what Amos is predicting.  My question to the American people today is, Is there a famine in the land???In Kentucky, a student kills three and wounds several others while the group is engaged in a prayer session.  In Mississippi a young man kills his mother, goes  to school and kills two others and wounds several.  In Tennessee a group of six teenagers led by a young woman who claimed to be the daughter of Satan kills a mother, a father, a young girl and wounds a two year old.  In Colorado 15 Methodist Bishops urge ordination of practicing homosexuals.  They even urge the church to perform same sex marriages.  T.V. programs are laced with foul language, sexual innuendoes, violence, corruption and we cry all is well.  Is there a famine in the land???Consider the tragedy of not having the Word of God.  BUT is it any less tragic to have it and not believe it?  Is it less tragic to have it and not appreciate it?  Is it less tragic to have it and not read it and be faithful to it?  Many trends we see in the world are people having little or no time to read and study the Bible.  Philosophy and entertainment have replaced truth.  Secular influence is making strong efforts to remove the influence of the Bible.  Jesus said in Matthew 5:6  Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, For they shall be filled.  Any church, nation or individual who has no craving for Divine truth will find the offering of truth taken away.  They will die of spiritual starvation.  May we all make an appeal to God for help in creating a spiritual awaking less there  be a famine in the land."

She also gave to her husband with her, and he ate.?? Affection is like a food web, which has complex interrelations and connectedness. Example: Father and child, mother and child (Note: Oxytocin, which aids affection, is secreted during pregnancy. Also, Studies show that his heart of a foetus will beat a little faster at the sound of your voice), parents and grandchildren, siblings, man and his fellow citizens or countrymen, man and his fellow worshippers.? The guiding psychological principle of human relationships — says that people of all ages become deeply connected with others who provide a sense of security and support. People never outgrow their ability and desire to form these connections.?The Challenge?The challenge now is distinguishing between love and lust due to the following reasons.? Everything in the world is lust: 1Jo 2:16 For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.? All the commandments are love: Mark 12:30-31'And you shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.' This is the first commandment.31 ""And the second, like it, is this: 'You shall love your neighbour as yourself.' There is no other commandment greater than these.""?What is love??- To feel tender affection for somebody.?- To feel desire for somebody.?- To like something very much.?What is Lust??- To feel strong desire to have sex with somebody.?- Uncontrolled or illicit sexual desire or appetite?- To have a very strong desire to obtain something.?In other words, lust could be said to be love outside of divine boundaries. ? God has set boundaries for everyone and for every activity of man under heaven. Our free moral agency is not without boundaries. Gen 2:16-17 ¶ And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, ""Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat; 17 ""but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.? When you don’t mind your boundaries, you’ll step over knowingly or unknowingly into the Devil’s territory. Ge 3:6 ¶ And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her;?Three levels of Love?1. Eros: The Greek word denotes carnal love. This kind of love operates in the flesh. It fades with time. It is erotic and only you are only permitted to show or to accept in marriage between i.e between two people (a man and a woman) who are LEGALLY married. Proverbs 7:1-end.?2. Phileo:  The Greek word denotes natural affection. It also denotes friendship. This kind of love operates in the soul. 2Sam 1:26 “I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan; You have been very pleasant to me; Your love to me was wonderful, Surpassing the love of women”.?3. Agape: The Greek word denotes charity, dear or love. It is the highest and holiest kind of love. John 3:16, 1 John 4:9-11, Rom 5:8 But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. ??Characteristics of Love as Opposed to Lust?• Every giving act of benevolence is not love but every genuine love is benevolent.1 Cor 3: 3¶ And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profits me nothing.?• 1Cor 3:4 ¶ Love suffers long and is kind; love does not envy; love does not parade itself, is not puffed up;?• 1Cor 3:5¶ does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil.?• 1Cor 3:6 ¶ Does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth;?• 1Cor 3:7¶ Bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.?• 1Cor 3:8 ¶ Love never fails. ?Lust is a sin, and sin kills. It is of the world and you can’t love the world and love the Lord, it is either you love God and hate the world or you hate God and love the world.??Effects of Lust (Gen 3?• It will kill you.?• It will hide you from God.?• It will bring fear into your heart instead of awe.?• It will make God appear to you like as a consuming fire not a loving father?• It will take away the glory of God from your life.?• It will drive out of divine provisions.?• It will deny access to heaven. ?• It will bring you labour instead of favour.?• Untold hardship and unproductive labour.?• It will bring you defeat instead of victory.?• It will cause you multiple sorrows. ?• It will cause you pains.?• It will produce ungodly affection and desires in your.?• It will take away your divine authority and you’ll become subjected.?•  It will attract to you divine curse and empower earthly curse in your life.?How to Gain Victory Over Lust?• Kill it before the stage of conception.  Jas 1:15 Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.?• Abstain from all appearance of evil. 1Th 5:22 Abstain from all appearance of evil.?• Do not conform to the system of this world: I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.?• Renew your mind: Ro 12:2 And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.?• Let the Word of Christ richly dwell in you: Col 3:16 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom.?• Allow the Holy Spirit: Ro 8:14 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God."

17100923,1,"The KNOWLEDGE of the SECRETS of the Kingdom of Heaven has been given to YOU, but not to them; Matthew 13:11.??Jesus, while talking with the DISCIPLES, after they asked Him: 'why do you speak in parables?', said to them: ?""not everything about God they could know, because, they did not do the WILL of God; only those that do the WILL of God will know very well about God. Whoever knows God and WALK in His WILL, will know Him MORE but those that do not know God, in their IGNORANCE they will PERISH.""??""whoever has will be given more, and he will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him."" --Matthew 13:12??Knowing God is not of Theology, Missionary or Seminary; neither is it of Professorial or Doctorate, nor of Age, White Garment, or VIGOROUS STUDYING of the Scripture. Knowing God is strictly an OBEDIENCE to the WILL of God.??""the Holy Spirit descended on Him in bodily form like a Dove. And a voice came from Heaven: 'You are My Son, Whom I Love; with You I am well pleased.'"" --Luke 3:22??""for God so Loved the World that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life."" --John 3:16??""for I have come down from Heaven not to do My will but to do the will of Him who sent Me."" --John 6:38??""I tell you the truth, unless you can eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood(believe in His WORDS), you have no life in you."" --John 6:53??""whoever believes in Me, as the Scripture has said, streams of living Water(Holy Spirit) will flow from within him."" --John 7:38??""but the Counsellor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you."" --John 14:26??""but God has revealed it to us by His Spirit. The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God."" --1 Corinthians 2:10??The WILL of God is to RECONCILE Man, YOU and I, back to Himself through Jesus Christ of Nazareth. Until you WALK in this WILL, your KNOWLEDGE of God is NOTHING but in PARABLE. And, it could lead you to PERISH; because, if you don't know God RIGHT, you can't WORSHIP Him RIGHT--in spirit(holiness) and truth.??It's good to know God through Jesus and REMAIN in Him. But, you can't walk with Jesus from FAR(sin), you have to come CLOSER(repent) and accept Him into your life.??I pray: Holy Spirit destroyed every OBSTACLE, force of darkness, that wants to stop you from taking a step in the right direction. And, may God open your MIND to UNDERSTANDING, in Jesus name. Amen."
