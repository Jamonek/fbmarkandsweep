17109181,1,"Rev. 1: 14-15 (v-14) ""And His head and hair were as white as white wool, as snow; and His eyes were like a flame of fire; (v-15) And His feet were like shining bronze as having been fired in a furnace; and His voice was like the sound of many waters.""??(v-14) White hair signifies great age (Job15:10). Here it indicates the ancientness of the Lord. In S.S. 5:11 He is depicted as having black hair, which signifies His unfading and everlasting strength. ??White wool issues from the nature of life, and white snow comes from heaven. White wool here and in Dan. 7:9 signifies that the ancientness of Christ is out of His nature, not out of His becoming old, while white snow signifies that His ancientness is heavenly, not earthly.??In S.S. 5:12 the eyes of Christ are like doves. That is for the expression of His love. Here His eyes are like a flame of fire. This is for Him to observe and search that He may exercise judgment by enlightening. In this book His eyes are not two but seven. These seven eyes of His are the seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, and the seven lamps are the seven Spirits of God. Thus, the eyes of Christ in this book are the seven Spirits of God for God's move and operation on earth today.??This book has a judging nature. Fire is for divine judgment. Our God is a consuming fire (Heb. 12:29) His throne is a fiery flame and its wheels are burning fire, and a fiery stream issues and comes forth from before Him (Dan. 7:9-10) and when He comes to take possession of the earth by exercising judgment over it, even His feet will be like pillars of fire. ??(v-15) Feet signify the walk. In typology bronze signifies divine judgment (Exo 27:1-6) The feet of Christ are like shining bronze, as mentioned also in Dan. 10:6 signifying that His perfect and bright walk qualifies Him to exercise divine judgment. ??To be fired in a furnace is to be tried by being burned. Christ's walk was tried by His sufferings, even by His death on the cross. Hence, His walk is bright, like shining bronze, which qualifies Him to judge the unrighteous. ??The sound of many waters, a tumultuous sound, is the sound of the voice of the Almighty God (Ezek. 1:24; 43:2). It signifies the seriousness and solemnity of His speaking. ?Blessings to you all, ""In the Name of Jesus."""

17109067,1,"When we say ""anniversary"" it is usually preceded with ""happy"", but today that is not the case.  15 years ago a young girl's body was found on Pine Point Rd.  Officers and Investigators dove into the case head first to identify who this child was, and to put together the puzzle pieces to answer a very big question, ""who would do this?""??Ultimately, she was identified as Ashley Elizabeth Ouellette, a 15 year old from Saco.  Ashley lived with both her parents and a younger sister.  She had a lot of friends, and she was a student at Thornton Academy.??Days passed and the investigation continued.  Ashley had been at a party the previous night and ended up at a home in Saco of two of her friends, Steve and Dan Sanborn.  The Sanborn's mother had made up the couch for Ashley to sleep on, and that is the last time anyone admits to seeing Ashley alive.??Very early the next morning a motorist came across Ashley's body laid in the middle of the roadway.  And so began the many years of heartache, disappointment, and unanswered questions for Ashley's family, friends, and case investigators.??Please join us today in remember a life lost too soon.  Wear purple to show your support.  There will also be a candle light vigil tonight at 6pm at Thornton Academy open to the public.??If today is the day you decide to stop hiding information, or protecting someone who does not deserve it, you can contact Detective Don Blatchford at 207-730-4312."

17109105,1,"Day 36??1 John 5:6-12??This is the one who came by water and blood –Jesus Christ. He did not come by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth. 7 For there are three that testify:8 the Spirit, the water and the blood; and the three are in agreement. 9 We accept man’s testimony, but God’s testimony is greater because it is the testimony of God, which he has given about his Son. 10 Anyone who believes in the Son of God has this testimony in his heart. Anyone who does not believe God has made him out to be a liar, because he has not believed the testimony God has given about his Son. 11 And this is the testimony:God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. 12 He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life.?_____________________________?John was fighting heretical teaching in the church.  Most prevalent was the denial of Jesus' deity.  And so, he is continually defending Jesus' deity.  He talks about three witnesses here: the Spirit, the water and the blood.  Obviously the Spirit is the Holy Spirit whose main job, according to verse 9, is to give testimony about the Son.  The water refers to Jesus baptism, where at his baptism, the Holy Spirit, in the form of a dove, descended on him and the Father declared Jesus to be his beloved Son. And then there is the bloos.  Jesus came in flesh and blood to the world by being born of a woman.  And then he shed his blood for his people.  So, all three of these give testimony to Jesus and his deity.??Why is this important?  Because of the testimony in verse 11: we have been given eternal life through the Son.  If we have the Son we have life.  If we don't have the Son, then we don't have life.  It's as simple as that.  We are so prone to add things to the gospel but it just boils down to Jesus.  If we have Jesus, we have everything. If we don't have Jesus, we have nothing.??So the question for us is, what is the Christian life for us?  If it's not about a daily, moment by moment relationship with Christ, then we have missed the entire biblical message.  Of course, from that relationship will flow many good things.  But let's get the main thing right.??1. Pray that we wouldn't get distracted in our Christian lives.?2. Pray that we would pursue Christ above all else.?3. Pray that the pre-believers around us would notice and be drawn to our beautiful Savior."

17109765,1,"February 10?St. Scholastica?(480-542?)??Twins often share the same interests and ideas with an equal intensity. Therefore, it is no surprise that Scholastica and her twin brother, Benedict (July 11), established religious communities within a few miles from each other. ??Born in 480 of wealthy parents, Scholastica and Benedict were brought up together until he left central Italy for Rome to continue his studies. ??Little is known of Scholastica’s early life. She founded a religious community for women near Monte Cassino at Plombariola, five miles from where her brother governed a monastery. ??The twins visited each other once a year in a farmhouse because Scholastica was not permitted inside the monastery. They spent these times discussing spiritual matters. ??According to the Dialogues of St. Gregory the Great, the brother and sister spent their last day together in prayer and conversation. Scholastica sensed her death was close at hand and she begged Benedict to stay with her until the next day. ??He refused her request because he did not want to spend a night outside the monastery, thus breaking his own Rule. Scholastica asked God to let her brother remain and a severe thunderstorm broke out, preventing Benedict and his monks from returning to the abbey. ??Benedict cried out, “God forgive you, Sister. What have you done?” Scholastica replied, “I asked a favor of you and you refused. I asked it of God and he granted it.” ??Brother and sister parted the next morning after their long discussion. Three days later, Benedict was praying in his monastery and saw the soul of his sister rising heavenward in the form of a white dove. Benedict then announced the death of his sister to the monks and later buried her in the tomb he had prepared for himself.??Comment:??Scholastica and Benedict gave themselves totally to God and gave top priority to deepening their friendship with him through prayer. They sacrificed some of the opportunities they would have had to be together as brother and sister in order better to fulfill their vocation to the religious life. In coming closer to Christ, however, they found they were also closer to each other. In joining a religious community, they did not forget or forsake their family but rather found more brothers and sisters.??Quote:??“All religious are under an obligation, in accordance with the particular vocation of each, to work zealously and diligently for the building up and growth of the whole mystical body of Christ and for the good of the particular churches. It is their duty to foster these objectives primarily by means of prayer, works of penance, and by the example of their own lives” (Vatican II, Decree on the Pastoral Office of Bishops, 33, Austin Flannery translation).??Patron Saint of:??Nuns"

THERE IS SOMETHING WHICH WILL MAKE MANY TO BE LEFT BEHIND ,ITS ANGER-SELF CONTROL,UNFORGIVENESS. Matthew  5:44 But I tell you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you,  5:45 that you may be children of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust. ?  WHEN  YOU MAKES SOMEBODY  ANGRY QUICKLY HEAL OUT HIS HEART AND MAKE A RESTORATION INSTANTLY BEFORE ITS TO LATE,,BEFORE THE JUDGE ALIVES,JESUS WOULD COME AT THAT MOMENT AND YOU WILL BE ACCUSED TO HELL DIRECT. Matthew  5:25 Agree with your adversary quickly, while you are with him in the way; lest perhaps the prosecutor deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be cast into prison. ? ANGER KILLS THE FIRE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT,IT WILL BLOW OFF THE LAMP ..IF YOU HOLD ANGER YOU HOLDS A STRONG EVIL CALLED HATENESS,,THIS EVIL WILL QUICKLY FLEE THE PRESENCE OF GOD IN YOU...ANGER WILL FLEE AWAY THE GRACE OF GOD IN YOU AND ANGER WILL BORN HATENESS..REMEMBER CAIN STARTED WITH ANGER THEN HE BECOME A KILLER.?

17101079,1,"Sunday’s Message?LOVE OR LUST??(By: Adegoke Raphael)?Everybody in life is created to love and to be loved God created man an emotional being. ?God created man in His own image and after His likeness. Meanwhile God Himself is an emotional being.?Some Evidences that Show God i as an Emotional Being?• Gen 1:26¶ Then God said, ""Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness.?• Gen 3:2 ¶ Then the LORD God said, ""Behold, the man has become like one of Us.?• Gen 11:7¶ Come, let Us go down.?• John 10:30¶ I and my Father are one.?• 1Jo 5:7 ¶For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.?•  1Jo 5:8 ¶And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.?God is so much emotional that he cannot do without the other members of the Godhead (Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost) as it can as well be seen during creation Gen 1:2-3 (The earth was without form, and void; and darkness was on the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.3 ¶ Then God said, ""Let there be light""; and there was light) and during Jesus’ baptism in Luke 3:22 (And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased).??Man: Created an Emotional Being?• Gen 2:18¶ And the LORD God said, ""It is not good that man should be alone; I will make him a helper comparable to him.""?• Gen 2:21-23 ¶ And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall on Adam, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place.22 Then the rib which the LORD God had taken from man He made into a woman, and He brought her to the man.23 And Adam said: ""This is now bone of my bones And flesh of my flesh; She shall be called Woman, Because she was taken out of Man.""?• Gen 3:6 ¶So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree desirable to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate. She also gave to her husband with her, and he ate.?? Affection is like a food web, which has complex interrelations and connectedness. Example: Father and child, mother and child (Note: Oxytocin, which aids affection, is secreted during pregnancy. Also, Studies show that his heart of a foetus will beat a little faster at the sound of your voice), parents and grandchildren, siblings, man and his fellow citizens or countrymen, man and his fellow worshippers.? The guiding psychological principle of human relationships — says that people of all ages become deeply connected with others who provide a sense of security and support. People never outgrow their ability and desire to form these connections.?The Challenge?The challenge now is distinguishing between love and lust due to the following reasons.? Everything in the world is lust: 1Jo 2:16 For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.? All the commandments are love: Mark 12:30-31'And you shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.' This is the first commandment.31 ""And the second, like it, is this: 'You shall love your neighbour as yourself.' There is no other commandment greater than these.""?What is love??- To feel tender affection for somebody.?- To feel desire for somebody.?- To like something very much.?What is Lust??- To feel strong desire to have sex with somebody.?- Uncontrolled or illicit sexual desire or appetite?- To have a very strong desire to obtain something.?In other words, lust could be said to be love outside of divine boundaries. ? God has set boundaries for everyone and for every activity of man under heaven. Our free moral agency is not without boundaries. Gen 2:16-17 ¶ And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, ""Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat; 17 ""but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.? When you don’t mind your boundaries, you’ll step over knowingly or unknowingly into the Devil’s territory. Ge 3:6 ¶ And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her;?Three levels of Love?1. Eros: The Greek word denotes carnal love. This kind of love operates in the flesh. It fades with time. It is erotic and only you are only permitted to show or to accept in marriage between i.e between two people (a man and a woman) who are LEGALLY married. Proverbs 7:1-end.?2. Phileo:  The Greek word denotes natural affection. It also denotes friendship. This kind of love operates in the soul. 2Sam 1:26 “I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan; You have been very pleasant to me; Your love to me was wonderful, Surpassing the love of women”.?3. Agape: The Greek word denotes charity, dear or love. It is the highest and holiest kind of love. John 3:16, 1 John 4:9-11, Rom 5:8 But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. ??Characteristics of Love as Opposed to Lust?• Every giving act of benevolence is not love but every genuine love is benevolent.1 Cor 3: 3¶ And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profits me nothing.?• 1Cor 3:4 ¶ Love suffers long and is kind; love does not envy; love does not parade itself, is not puffed up;?• 1Cor 3:5¶ does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil.?• 1Cor 3:6 ¶ Does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth;?• 1Cor 3:7¶ Bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.?• 1Cor 3:8 ¶ Love never fails. ?Lust is a sin, and sin kills. It is of the world and you can’t love the world and love the Lord, it is either you love God and hate the world or you hate God and love the world.??Effects of Lust (Gen 3?• It will kill you.?• It will hide you from God.?• It will bring fear into your heart instead of awe.?• It will make God appear to you like as a consuming fire not a loving father?• It will take away the glory of God from your life.?• It will drive out of divine provisions.?• It will deny access to heaven. ?• It will bring you labour instead of favour.?• Untold hardship and unproductive labour.?• It will bring you defeat instead of victory.?• It will cause you multiple sorrows. ?• It will cause you pains.?• It will produce ungodly affection and desires in your.?• It will take away your divine authority and you’ll become subjected.?•  It will attract to you divine curse and empower earthly curse in your life.?How to Gain Victory Over Lust?• Kill it before the stage of conception.  Jas 1:15 Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.?• Abstain from all appearance of evil. 1Th 5:22 Abstain from all appearance of evil.?• Do not conform to the system of this world: I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.?• Renew your mind: Ro 12:2 And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.?• Let the Word of Christ richly dwell in you: Col 3:16 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom.?• Allow the Holy Spirit: Ro 8:14 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God."
17110462,1,"From the books of Dialogues by Saint Gregory the Great, pope?(Lib. 2, 33: PL 66, 194-196)??She who loved more could do more??Scholastica, the sister of Saint Benedict, had been consecrated to God from her earliest years. She was accustomed to visiting her brother once a year. He would come down to meet her at a place on the monastery property, not far outside the gate.??One day she came as usual and her saintly brother went with some of his disciples; they spent the whole day praising God and talking of sacred things. As night fell they had supper together.??Their spiritual conversation went on and the hour grew late. The holy nun said to her brother: “Please do not leave me tonight; let us go on until morning talking about the delights of the spiritual life.” “Sister,” he replied, “what are you saying? I simply cannot stay outside my cell.”??When she heard her brother refuse her request, the holy woman joined her hands on the table, laid her head on them and began to pray. As she raised her head from the table, there were such brilliant flashes of lightning, such great peals of thunder and such a heavy downpour of rain that neither Benedict nor his brethren could stir across the threshold of the place where they had been seated. Sadly he began to complain: “May God forgive you, sister. What have you done?” “Well,” she answered, “I asked you and you would not listen; so I asked my God and he did listen. So now go off, if you can, leave me and return to your monastery.”??Reluctant as he was to stay of his own will, he remained against his will. So it came about that they stayed awake the whole night, engrossed in their conversation about the spiritual life.??It is not surprising that she was more effective than he, since as John says, God is love, it was absolutely right that she could do more, as she loved more.??Three days later, Benedict was in his cell. Looking up to the sky, he saw his sister’s soul leave her body in the form of a dove, and fly up to the secret places of heaven. Rejoicing in her great glory, he thanked almighty God with hymns and words of praise. He then sent his brethren to bring her body to the monastery and lay it in the tomb he had prepared for himself.??Their minds had always been united in God; their bodies were to share a common grave."

17103093,1,"JOHN  1?1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.?2 The same was in the beginning with God.?3 All things were made through him. Without him was not anything made that has been made.?4 In him was life, and the life was the light of men.?5 The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness hasn’t overcome it.?6 There came a man, sent from God, whose name was John.?7 The same came as a witness, that he might testify about the light, that all might believe through him.?8 He was not the light, but was sent that he might testify about the light.?9 The true light that enlightens everyone was coming into the world.?10 He was in the world, and the world was made through him, and the world didn’t recognize him.?11 He came to his own, and those who were his own didn’t receive him.?12 But as many as received him, to them he gave the right to become God’s children, to those who believe in his name:?13 who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.?14 The Word became flesh, and lived among us. We saw his glory, such glory as of the one and only Son of the Father, full of grace and truth.?15 John testified about him. He cried out, saying, “This was he of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me has surpassed me, for he was before me.’”?16 From his fullness we all received grace upon grace.?17 For the law was given through Moses. Grace and truth were realized through Jesus Christ.?18 No one has seen God at any time. The one and only Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.?19 This is John’s testimony, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?”?20 He declared, and didn’t deny, but he declared, “I am not the Christ.”?21 They asked him, “What then? Are you Elijah?” He said, “I am not.” “Are you the prophet?” He answered, “No.”?22 They said therefore to him, “Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”?23 He said, “I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way of the Lord,’ as Isaiah the prophet said.”?24 The ones who had been sent were from the Pharisees.?25 They asked him, “Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?”?26 John answered them, “I baptize in water, but among you stands one whom you don’t know.?27 He is the one who comes after me, who is preferred before me, whose sandal strap I’m not worthy to loosen.”?28 These things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.?29 The next day, he saw Jesus coming to him, and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!?30 This is he of whom I said, ‘After me comes a man who is preferred before me, for he was before me.’?31 I didn’t know him, but for this reason I came baptizing in water: that he would be revealed to Israel.”?32 John testified, saying, “I have seen the Spirit descending like a dove out of heaven, and it remained on him.?33 I didn’t recognize him, but he who sent me to baptize in water, he said to me, ‘On whomever you will see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.’?34 I have seen, and have testified that this is the Son of God.”?35 Again, the next day, John was standing with two of his disciples,?36 and he looked at Jesus as he walked, and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God!”?37 The two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.?38 Jesus turned, and saw them following, and said to them, “What are you looking for?” They said to him, “Rabbi” (which is to say, being interpreted, Teacher), “where are you staying?”?39 He said to them, “Come, and see.” They came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day. It was about the tenth hour.?40 One of the two who heard John, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.?41 He first found his own brother, Simon, and said to him, “We have found the Messiah!” (which is, being interpreted, Christ).?42 He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him, and said, “You are Simon the son of Jonah. You shall be called Cephas” (which is by interpretation, Peter).?43 On the next day, he was determined to go out into Galilee, and he found Philip. Jesus said to him, “Follow me.”?44 Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.?45 Philip found Nathanael, and said to him, “We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote: Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.”?46 Nathanael said to him, “Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?” Philip said to him, “Come and see.”?47 Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said about him, “Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit!”?48 Nathanael said to him, “How do you know me?” Jesus answered him, “Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.”?49 Nathanael answered him, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are King of Israel!”?50 Jesus answered him, “Because I told you, ‘I saw you underneath the fig tree,’ do you believe? You will see greater things than these!”?51 He said to him, “Most certainly, I tell you, hereafter you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”"

17108996,1,"Matthew 10:1 And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease. 2 Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother; 3 Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus; 4 Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him. 5 These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not: 6 But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. 7 And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand. 8 Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give. 9 Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses, 10 Nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat. 11 And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, enquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence. 12 And when ye come into an house, salute it. 13 And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you. 14 And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet. 15 Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.??16 Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves. 17 But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues; 18 And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles. 19 But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak. 20 For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you. 21 And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death. 22 And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved. 23 But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come. 24 The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his lord. 25 It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his household? 26 Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known. 27 What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops. 28 And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. 29 Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father. 30 But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. 31 Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows."

Therefore, it is no surprise that Scholastica and her twin brother, Benedict (July 11), established religious communities within a few miles from each other.?Born in 480 of wealthy parents, Scholastica and Benedict were brought up together until he left central Italy for Rome to continue his studies.??Little is known of Scholastica’s early life. She founded a religious community for women near Monte Cassino at Plombariola, five miles from where her brother governed a monastery.??The twins visited each other once a year in a farmhouse because Scholastica was not permitted inside the monastery. They spent these times discussing spiritual matters.??According to the Dialogues of St. Gregory the Great, the brother and sister spent their last day together in prayer and conversation. Scholastica sensed her death was close at hand and she begged Benedict to stay with her until the next day.??He refused her request because he did not want to spend a night outside the monastery, thus breaking his own Rule. Scholastica asked God to let her brother remain and a severe thunderstorm broke out, preventing Benedict and his monks from returning to the abbey.??Benedict cried out, “God forgive you, Sister. What have you done?” Scholastica replied, “I asked a favor of you and you refused. I asked it of God and he granted it.”??Brother and sister parted the next morning after their long discussion. Three days later, Benedict was praying in his monastery and saw the soul of his sister rising heavenward in the form of a white dove. Benedict then announced the death of his sister to the monks and later buried her in the tomb he had prepared for himself.??Scholastica and Benedict gave themselves totally to God and gave top priority to deepening their friendship with him through prayer. They sacrificed some of the opportunities they would have had to be together as brother and sister in order better to fulfill their vocation to the religious life. In coming closer to Christ, however, they found they were also closer to each other. In joining a religious community, they did not forget or forsake their family but rather found more brothers and sisters.??“All religious are under an obligation, in accordance with the particular vocation of each, to work zealously and diligently for the building up and growth of the whole mystical body of Christ and for the good of the particular churches. It is their duty to foster these objectives primarily by means of prayer, works of penance, and by the example of their own lives” (Vatican II, Decree on the Pastoral Office of Bishops, 33, Austin Flannery translation)."

17109262,1,"When we say ""anniversary"" it is usually preceded with ""happy"", but today that is not the case. 15 years ago a young girl's body was found on Pine Point Rd. Officers and Investigators dove into the case head first to identify who this child was, and to put together the puzzle pieces to answer a very big question, ""who would do this?""??Ultimately, she was identified as Ashley Erin Ouellette, a 15 year old from Saco. Ashley lived with both her parents and a younger sister. She had a lot of friends, and she was a student at Thornton Academy.??Days passed and the investigation continued. Ashley had been at a party the previous night and ended up at a home in Saco of two of her friends, Steve and Dan Sanborn. The Sanborn's mother had made up the couch for Ashley to sleep on, and that is the last time anyone admits to seeing Ashley alive.??Very early the next morning a motorist came across Ashley's body laid in the middle of the roadway. And so began the many years of heartache, disappointment, and unanswered questions for Ashley's family, friends, and case investigators.??Please join us today in remember a life lost too soon.

17110645,1,"~ For today ~ ??~ Ecclesiastes 9:9 ~ NLT ~?Live happily with the woman you love through all the meaningless days of life that God has given you under the sun. The wife God gives you is your reward for all your earthly toil.??One of the most important things u should learn on ur journey is that u should not just follow ur heart, but u should lead it. Don't let ur feelings & emotions do the driving, put them in the back seat & tell them where ur going.??Nobody can maintain a burning desire of togetherness just on feelings alone. But it's difficult to love someone only out of obligation. However, there is something just as powerful as that fresh , new love. It comes from the decision to delight in ur spouse & to love him/her no matter how long you've been married. In other words, love that chooses to love is just as powerful as love that feels like loving. In other words, it's truer love because it has its eyes wide open.??Left to ourselves, we'll always lean toward being disapproving one another. Nerves, aggravation, bickering over petty things & so on... Instead it's time to lead ur heart to once again delight in ur mate. Remember why u fell in love in the first place & let that love back into ur heart.??Again, u get to choose what u treasure. It's not like your 're born with certain pre-sets & preferences you're destined to operate from. If ur irritable, it's because u choose to be.If u pick at ur mate more than u praise them, it's because you've allowed ur heart to be selfish. You've led urself into criticism. So now it's time to lead ur heart back out. ??It's time to delight in ur spouse again, then to watch ur heart actually start enjoying who they are. The Bible contains love stories in the Song of Solomon there are 2 lovers who take pleasure in one another such as :??Song of Solomon 2:3-4 -?Like the finest apple tree in the orchard is my lover among other young men. I sit in his delightful shade and taste his delicious fruit. He escorts me to the banquet hall; it’s obvious how much he loves me. ??Song of Solomon 2:13-14 -?The fig trees are forming young fruit, and the fragrant grapevines are blossoming. Rise up, my darling! Come away with me, my fair one!” My dove is hiding behind the rocks, behind an outcrop on the cliff. Let me see your face; let me hear your voice. For your voice is pleasant, & your face is lovely??It's time to remember why u once fell in love. To laugh, to flirt & dream again. Delightfully. For some , the move towards delight  maybe only a small step away. For others, it may require a giant leap from ongoing disgust. But if delighted before - which u were when u got married- u can be delighted again.

And the Lamb of God went forth and was baptized of him; and after he was baptized, I beheld the heavens open, and the Holy Ghost come down out of heaven and abide upon him in the form of a dove.? 28 And I beheld that he went forth ministering unto the people, in power and great glory; and the multitudes were gathered together to hear him; and I beheld that they cast him out from among them.? 29 And I also beheld twelve others following him. And it came to pass that they were carried away in the Spirit from before my face, and I saw them not."

17104506,1,"Monday, February 10?Memorial of Scholastica, virgin, religious?Make every visitation sacred?Once a year Saint Scholastica and her equally busy brother, Saint Benedict, would pause to visit each other for a day. At one of these meetings Scholastica wanted Benedict to linger on but he insisted on going. Tradition has it that Scholastica prayed that God hear the request her brother was ignoring, and a furious storm came up, forcing him to stay longer. Back home three days later, Benedict saw his sister’s soul leaving the earth and ascending to heaven in the form of a shining white dove. Cherish each visit with a loved one as if it were your last.?Today’s readings: 1 Kings 8:1-7, 9-13; Mark 6:53-56 (329). “They . . . began to bring in the sick on mats to wherever they heard he was.”?preparetheword.com"
17099684,1,"As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him. And a voice from heaven said, “This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.” Messiah would be declared the Son of God. Psalm 2:7"
17109066,1,"10 February??SAINT SCHOLASTICA ?Abbess?(+ c. 543)??        Of this Saint but little is known on earth, save that she was the sister of the great patriarch St. Benedict, and that, under his direction, she founded and governed a numerous community near Monte Casino.??        St. Gregory sums up her life by saying that she devoted herself to God from her childhood, and that her pure soul went to God in the likeness of a dove, as if to show that her life had been enriched with the fullest gifts of the Holy Spirit.??        Her brother was accustomed to visit her every year, for ""she could not be sated or wearied with the words of grace which flowed from his lips."" On his last visit, after a day passed in spiritual converse, the Saint, knowing that her end was near, said, ""My brother, leave me not, I pray you, this night, but discourse with me till dawn on the bliss of those who see God in heaven."" St. Benedict would not, break his rule at the bidding of natural affection; and then the Saint bowed her head on her hands and prayed; and there arose a storm so violent that St. Benedict could not return to his monastery, and they passed the night in heavenly conversation.??        Three days later St. Benedict saw in a vision the soul of his sister going up in the likeness of a dove into heaven. Then he gave thanks to God for the graces He had given her, and for the glory which had crowned them. When she died, St. Benedict, her spiritual daughters, and the monks sent by St. Benedict mingled their tears and prayed, ""Alas! alas! dearest mother, to whom dost thou leave us now? Pray for us to Jesus, to Whom thou art gone."" They then devoutly celebrated holy Mass, ""commending her soul to God;"" and her body was borne to Monte Casino, and laid by her brother in the tomb he had prepared for himself."" And they bewailed her many days;"" and St. Benedict said, ""Weep not, sisters and brothers; for assuredly Jesus has taken her before us to be our aid and defence against all our enemies, that we may stand in the evil day and be in all things perfect.""??        She died about the year 543.??Lives of the Saints, by Alban Butler, Benziger Bros. ed. [1894]"

Markets will be hoping for reassurance that policy will stay loose for a long time to come.??The dollar had begun to retreat as European trading gathered pace, softened by questions over Yellen's stance and what if any impact a second successive month of uncertain jobs data could have on the Fed's stimulus withdrawal.??It was last trading at $1.3644 to the euro and was buying 102.20 yen, a turnaround from Asian trading when it had bobbed as high as 102.41.??""I think the market is bit on the dovish side of where it should be,"" Saxo Capital Markets chairman Nick Beecroft said.??""Given the perception of Janet Yellen being a dove, if she doesn't come over extra-dovish it could be a bit of a disappointment.""??Both stocks and the dollar initially retreated when Friday's U.S. payrolls report showed a rise of only 113,000 in January, falling well short of forecasts. The damage was limited by a very strong household survey in which a sharp jump in the number of people employed nudged the jobless rate down to 6.6 percent.??That mixed bag of data left Treasuries little changed with yields on 10-year notes a shade lower at 2.67 percent in early Monday trade.??In commodities, oil prices lost momentum having initially extended their recent gains as persistently cold weather across the United States continued to eat into heating fuel stocks.??U.S. crude made an early six-week peak at $100.46 a barrel but could not force its way past the December high at $100.75. Brent crude oil futures gave up 21 cents of last week's gains to stand at $109.35 a barrel.??Spot gold was also firm at $1,271.70 an ounce, but faces stiff resistance from $1,273 to $1,278.??YELLEN FROM THE HILL??Japan's Nikkei led the way in Asian trading, with a rise of 1.3 percent to 14,668, and away from last week's trough at 13,995. Shanghai also added 1.7 percent after its recent sell-off.??But emerging market tensions were back in focus after credit rating downgrades late on Friday for Turkey and Ukraine, two of the countries most under fire in markets.??Turkey's lira and its main stock market suffered their biggest falls in a week although losses in Ukrainian assets were limited by its imposition from Friday of capital controls.??Expectations that cuts in U.S. monetary stimulus, which has buoyed risk assets for several years, are one of the main reasons for the pressure being seen in emerging markets.??Fed chair Yellen will be able to offer her own reading of the jobs report before lawmakers this week, which could give markets a fresh steer on the pace of stimulus withdrawal.??Analysts generally assume she will stick to the script of recent policy meetings, reiterating that a gradual decline in asset buying is likely as long as the economy continues to improve as assumed.??""We expect her to state that tapering is not on a pre-set course and the committee will adjust course as needed, particularly if the expected firming in growth and gains in payrolls do not persist,"" Barclays analysts said in a note.??Yellen is also likely to repeat the standard forward guidance that the funds rate will remain near zero until the unemployment rate falls well below 6.5 percent, as long as inflation is subdued.??BEARS IN THE CHINA SHOP??Major U.S. data includes retail sales on Thursday, for which a flat result is forecast due partly to bad weather and a rise in gasoline prices.??China releases trade numbers on Wednesday and consumer prices on Friday. Analysts at Commonwealth Bank of Australia predict exports will have shrunk in January but mainly because of significant base effects as January last year saw an outsized 25 percent increase.??Trade flows can be very volatile in January and February because of the timing of the Lunar New Year holiday.??The euro zone releases its first estimate of economic growth on Friday and forecasts favour a slim 0.2 percent increase in the fourth quarter, which would keep pressure on for more action from the European Central Bank.??ECB President Mario Draghi gives a speech on ""Progress Through Crisis?"" on Wednesday and markets will be sensitive to any hint of further accommodation to come.??The Bank of England issues its February Inflation Report on Wednesday, which is likely show price pressures are muted and so support the outlook for low rates.??BoE chief Mark Carney is expected to sketch out a new format for forward guidance after a quicker-than-expected fall in unemployment undermined an original plan, outlined in August."

17106754,1,"Monday Mass Reading & Meditation for February 10, 2014 + Saint of the Day??Memorial of Saint Scholastica, Virgin ?Reading 11 KGS 8:1-7, 9-13??The elders of Israel and all the leaders of the tribes,?the princes in the ancestral houses of the children of Israel,?came to King Solomon in Jerusalem,?to bring up the ark of the LORD’s covenant?from the City of David, which is Zion.?All the people of Israel assembled before King Solomon?during the festival in the month of Ethanim (the seventh month).?When all the elders of Israel had arrived,?the priests took up the ark;?they carried the ark of the LORD?and the meeting tent with all the sacred vessels?that were in the tent.?(The priests and Levites carried them.)??King Solomon and the entire community of Israel?present for the occasion?sacrificed before the ark sheep and oxen?too many to number or count.?The priests brought the ark of the covenant of the LORD?to its place beneath the wings of the cherubim in the sanctuary,?the holy of holies of the temple.?The cherubim had their wings spread out over the place of the ark,?sheltering the ark and its poles from above.?There was nothing in the ark but the two stone tablets?which Moses had put there at Horeb,?when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel?at their departure from the land of Egypt.??When the priests left the holy place,?the cloud filled the temple of the LORD?so that the priests could no longer minister because of the cloud,?since the LORD’s glory had filled the temple of the LORD.?Then Solomon said, “The LORD intends to dwell in the dark cloud;?I have truly built you a princely house,?a dwelling where you may abide forever.”?Responsorial Psalm PS 132:6-7, 8-10?R. (8a) Lord, go up to the place of your rest!?Behold, we heard of it in Ephrathah;?we found it in the fields of Jaar.?Let us enter into his dwelling,?let us worship at his footstool.?R. Lord, go up to the place of your rest!?Advance, O LORD, to your resting place,?you and the ark of your majesty.?May your priests be clothed with justice;?let your faithful ones shout merrily for joy.?For the sake of David your servant,?reject not the plea of your anointed.?R. Lord, go up to the place of your rest!?Gospel MK 6:53-56?After making the crossing to the other side of the sea,?Jesus and his disciples came to land at Gennesaret?and tied up there.?As they were leaving the boat, people immediately recognized him.?They scurried about the surrounding country ?and began to bring in the sick on mats?to wherever they heard he was.?Whatever villages or towns or countryside he entered,?they laid the sick in the marketplaces?and begged him that they might touch only the tassel on his cloak;?and as many as touched it were healed.?Meditation: 1 Kings 8:1-7, 9-13?The cloud filled the temple of the Lord. (1 Kings 8:10)??Have you ever noticed that when a couple moves into their first home together, they spend a lot of time and money making it “their space”? Furniture, rugs, pictures, and personal belongings create a unique and personal atmosphere. In today’s first reading, a different kind of space was prepared, a holy space where the Lord could dwell among his people. And like that new couple, Solomon spared no expense in making this space as precious as possible.??There seems to be something very important about creating holy spaces. Think of the cathedrals around the world where people have worshipped for centuries. Or maybe you have a childhood memory of a chapel where you felt close to the Lord. All of these spaces have been set apart, dedicated for just one purpose. Somehow they help us to quiet our minds and hearts to be with Jesus.??Yet busy schedules and hectic lives can make it very difficult to find the time to visit a church every day. That’s why it’s a good idea to try to create a space in our homes that is set apart for prayer.??What would such a space look like? Well, it could be a separate room in your home or just a favorite chair in the corner of your living room. It doesn’t have to be ornately decorated as Solomon’s Temple was, but it should be set apart in some way. Maybe you could hang a crucifix or an icon on the wall in this space. Maybe a table with a candle and your Bible can set it apart. If you know that clutter distracts you, take it out. Let the simplicity of the space invite you to clear your mind and open your heart.??Today, brainstorm about a space that you can set apart as dedicated to prayer. Be creative. Don’t worry if it doesn’t happen all at once. When you have chosen and prepared your space, invite the Lord to fill it with his presence through his Holy Spirit. Even if you can’t see the cloud of his glory as they did in the Old Testament, you can be sure that he is there.??“Lord, help me to find a place to meet with you every day.”??Psalm 132:6-10; Mark 6:53-56??Saint Scholastica, Virgin?Twins often share the same interests and ideas with an equal intensity. Therefore, it is no surprise that Scholastica and her twin brother, Benedict (July 11), established religious communities within a few miles from each other.?Born in 480 of wealthy parents, Scholastica and Benedict were brought up together until he left central Italy for Rome to continue his studies.??Little is known of Scholastica’s early life. She founded a religious community for women near Monte Cassino at Plombariola, five miles from where her brother governed a monastery.??The twins visited each other once a year in a farmhouse because Scholastica was not permitted inside the monastery. They spent these times discussing spiritual matters.??According to the Dialogues of St. Gregory the Great, the brother and sister spent their last day together in prayer and conversation. Scholastica sensed her death was close at hand and she begged Benedict to stay with her until the next day.??He refused her request because he did not want to spend a night outside the monastery, thus breaking his own Rule. Scholastica asked God to let her brother remain and a severe thunderstorm broke out, preventing Benedict and his monks from returning to the abbey.??Benedict cried out, “God forgive you, Sister. What have you done?” Scholastica replied, “I asked a favor of you and you refused. I asked it of God and he granted it.”??Brother and sister parted the next morning after their long discussion. Three days later, Benedict was praying in his monastery and saw the soul of his sister rising heavenward in the form of a white dove. Benedict then announced the death of his sister to the monks and later buried her in the tomb he had prepared for himself.??Comment:?Scholastica and Benedict gave themselves totally to God and gave top priority to deepening their friendship with him through prayer. They sacrificed some of the opportunities they would have had to be together as brother and sister in order better to fulfill their vocation to the religious life. In coming closer to Christ, however, they found they were also closer to each other. In joining a religious community, they did not forget or forsake their family but rather found more brothers and sisters.?Quote:?“All religious are under an obligation, in accordance with the particular vocation of each, to work zealously and diligently for the building up and growth of the whole mystical body of Christ and for the good of the particular churches. It is their duty to foster these objectives primarily by means of prayer, works of penance, and by the example of their own lives” (Vatican II, Decree on the Pastoral Office of Bishops, 33, Austin Flannery translation).?Patron Saint of:?Nuns?-- ?Have a Blessed Day"

17103871,0,"Ugh, yet another week has gone by, and still no regular workouts... I did got back on my bike twice last week, and though I felt immediately out of breath (!) I loved every minute! I'm now looking forward to better weather, as there is a stormy wind blowing at the moment, so I can get back on my bike and increase my fitness level asap!! ??As for working out at home with my weights; I really have to stop making excuses, get off the couch and move my butt! The strange thing is, when I do workout I feel great! Not only afterwards, but while I'm working out too, coz I really do love lifting weights!!! So why can't I get back into my workout regime???? Okay, I am still struggling to shake off this persistent cold I have. But other than that, I'm just too lazy! At night I tell myself tomorrow; when I try my arse back into the jeans that fell off my butt last year, and it ain't happening this year, I swear I will start again tomorrow. But when tomorrow is there I just can't be asked to get off the couch, and tell myself tomorrow is another day... Well tomorrow has arrived FFS, wether I like it or not!!! NO MORE EXCUSES!!!!??I also decided to stop making my own meal plans for a while. When I first started my journey to a healthy body, I was so overwhelmed by all the information about eating clean, macros, fitness etc. I decided it was easier to just follow pre-made meal plans. At least that way I was certain that I eat healthy, get all the daily necessary nutrients and learn about portion control. I used the 14 days meal plan from every issue of Clean Eating magazine and followed them to the T. I lost almost 32 lbs in a year! But then I wanted more than just lose weight; I wanted to get a fit, strong, muscular body too. And the more I dove into the whole fitness world, the more I altered the pre-made meal plans to suit my level of fitness. But somewhere down the line I lost control and I'm now really winging it. ??In the last year I have gained back a little over 17 lbs (of which I'm sure is some muscle too) but it's time to get back to basics, and back to the pre-made meal plans. For now I'll forget about the special macros for muscle building, and stick to what has proved to me it works. So I ditched up a present from my good friend Gina Wheeler Zwart; Clean Eating Mag.'s 16 Week Meal Plan and started today right at the beginning: week 1, day 1, meal 1... And later today it's workout time. ??Have a great week ya all!"

17108392,1,"Monday, February 10, 2014 ?Saint of the Day ?St. Scholastica ?(480-542?)   ??Twins often share the same interests and ideas with an equal intensity. Therefore, it is no surprise that Scholastica and her twin brother, Benedict (July 11), established religious communities within a few miles from each other. ?Born in 480 of wealthy parents, Scholastica and Benedict were brought up together until he left central Italy for Rome to continue his studies. ??Little is known of Scholastica’s early life. She founded a religious community for women near Monte Cassino at Plombariola, five miles from where her brother governed a monastery. ??The twins visited each other once a year in a farmhouse because Scholastica was not permitted inside the monastery. They spent these times discussing spiritual matters. ??According to the Dialogues of St. Gregory the Great, the brother and sister spent their last day together in prayer and conversation. Scholastica sensed her death was close at hand and she begged Benedict to stay with her until the next day. ??He refused her request because he did not want to spend a night outside the monastery, thus breaking his own Rule. Scholastica asked God to let her brother remain and a severe thunderstorm broke out, preventing Benedict and his monks from returning to the abbey. ??Benedict cried out, “God forgive you, Sister. What have you done?” Scholastica replied, “I asked a favor of you and you refused. I asked it of God and he granted it.” ??Brother and sister parted the next morning after their long discussion. Three days later, Benedict was praying in his monastery and saw the soul of his sister rising heavenward in the form of a white dove. Benedict then announced the death of his sister to the monks and later buried her in the tomb he had prepared for himself.? ?Scholastica and Benedict gave themselves totally to God and gave top priority to deepening their friendship with him through prayer. They sacrificed some of the opportunities they would have had to be together as brother and sister in order better to fulfill their vocation to the religious life. In coming closer to Christ, however, they found they were also closer to each other. In joining a religious community, they did not forget or forsake their family but rather found more brothers and sisters."

Scholastica asked God to let her brother remain and a severe thunderstorm broke out, preventing Benedict and his monks from returning to the abbey.??Benedict cried out, “God forgive you, Sister. What have you done?” Scholastica replied, “I asked a favor of you and you refused. I asked it of God and he granted it.”??Brother and sister parted the next morning after their long discussion. Three days later, Benedict was praying in his monastery and saw the soul of his sister rising heavenward in the form of a white dove. Benedict then announced the death of his sister to the monks and later buried her in the tomb he had prepared for himself.~"

17104508,1,"Monday, February 10?Memorial of Scholastica, virgin, religious?Make every visitation sacred?Once a year Saint Scholastica and her equally busy brother, Saint Benedict, would pause to visit each other for a day. At one of these meetings Scholastica wanted Benedict to linger on but he insisted on going. Tradition has it that Scholastica prayed that God hear the request her brother was ignoring, and a furious storm came up, forcing him to stay longer. Back home three days later, Benedict saw his sister’s soul leaving the earth and ascending to heaven in the form of a shining white dove. Cherish each visit with a loved one as if it were your last.?Today’s readings: 1 Kings 8:1-7, 9-13; Mark 6:53-56 (329). “They . . . began to bring in the sick on mats to wherever they heard he was.”?preparetheword.com"

Yet you are CREATING the very body issues these woman have to fight by marketing a cream that makes them reconsider what is normal  - the USP is that fair = good, dark = bad.  It's a market YOU have created so you can sell a product created solely to play on women's insecurities.  Your PR-friendly statement is disingenuous in the extreme.

17104456,1,"Second reading?From the books of Dialogues by Saint Gregory the Great, pope?She who loved more could do more??Scholastica, the sister of Saint Benedict, had been consecrated to God from her earliest years. She was accustomed to visiting her brother once a year. He would come down to meet her at a place on the monastery property, not far outside the gate.??One day she came as usual and her saintly brother went with some of his disciples; they spent the whole day praising God and talking of sacred things. As night fell they had supper together.??Their spiritual conversation went on and the hour grew late. The holy nun said to her brother: “Please do not leave me tonight; let us go on until morning talking about the delights of the spiritual life.” “Sister,” he replied, “what are you saying? I simply cannot stay outside my cell.”??When she heard her brother refuse her request, the holy woman joined her hands on the table, laid her head on them and began to pray. As she raised her head from the table, there were such brilliant flashes of lightning, such great peals of thunder and such a heavy downpour of rain that neither Benedict nor his brethren could stir across the threshold of the place where they had been seated. Sadly he began to complain: “May God forgive you, sister. What have you done?” “Well,” she answered, “I asked you and you would not listen; so I asked my God and he did listen. So now go off, if you can, leave me and return to your monastery.”??Reluctant as he was to stay of his own will, he remained against his will. So it came about that they stayed awake the whole night, engrossed in their conversation about the spiritual life.??It is not surprising that she was more effective than he, since as John says, God is love, it was absolutely right that she could do more, as she loved more.??Three days later, Benedict was in his cell. Looking up to the sky, he saw his sister’s soul leave her body in the form of a dove, and fly up to the secret places of heaven. Rejoicing in her great glory, he thanked almighty God with hymns and words of praise. He then sent his brethren to bring her body to the monastery and lay it in the tomb he had prepared for himself.??Their minds had always been united in God; their bodies were to share a common grave.??RESPONSORY??When the saintly nun begged the Lord that her brother might not leave her,?– she received more than her brother did from the Lord of her heart because she loved him so much.??How good, how delightful it is for brothers and sisters to live in unity.?– She received more than her brother did from the Lord of her heart because she loved him so much."

17103214,1,"I SOUGHT THE LORD??Mark 4:10-11, Psalm 34:4-5, Matt 7:7, Luke 15: 11-32, Matt 11:12, Daniel 9:3, Gen 28:20, Psalm 30:5, 1 Samuel 1:15-20, 1 Samuel 1: 5-6, Genesis 32:22-28, 1 Chronicles 4:9-10??Men and brethren, if you understand God from the depth of your heart and seek this awesomely awesome God, you will know that there is no secret before Him. The scripture says “But when He was alone, those around Him with the twelve asked Him about the parable. And He said to them, To you it has been given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God; but to those who are outside, all things come in parables.” Mark 4:10-11.??What do you see when you are alone in the secret place of heart? What do you do when you need help, looked around your friends, your relations and environment and found none? Psalm 34:4-5 says, “I sought the LORD, and He heard me, and delivered me from all my fears. They looked unto Him and were lightened: and their faces were not ashamed.” This is kingdom pattern and formula for living. Look up to God and keep looking up to God, not on your relations abroad because ‘Help does not come from Abroad but from Above’. Several problems in life remain untouched because we have not touched God in our mind and prayers.??Right where you are, it takes understanding of the mysteries of the word and understanding of the ways of God to command supernatural victory over every battle we fight, and helps in bringing God into our situation. The mind set of seeking God daily and Prayers will also help us to fight back to whatever that has hindered, disgraced and humiliated us. Fighting back does not necessarily mean carrying guns. Under the sun, prayer is the most powerful thing. It does not matter the nature of weapons our enemies are using against us; prayer has more power than chemical weapon. The man who prays in His will can pray for anything and for everything if he believes and God can give anything and everything to the believer. Heb 11:6.Let me remind you the mysteries of praying in levels and praying according to the secrets revealed to us in the scriptures.??Number One: ‘Ask’- Matthew 7:7. Asking prayer is to put a question that demands an answer. Asking is when there is life’s confusion and chaos, ‘Master, carest thou not that we perish?’ Mark 4:38. It means to make a request, it means to expect or demand an explanation from God. The scripture is clear that we don’t have because we don’t ask John 16:24. In the parable of the prodigal son, we read about the importance of asking. ‘Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends Luke 15: 11-32’. He never merry because he did not ask; therefore our personal and collective merriment is tied to our ability to ask.??Number Two: ‘Seek’ -To seek is to locate or discover, for unless you locate your placement in life, which is your location through the direction of the HolySpirit; you cannot possess your possessions. Therefore, to seek is to endeavour to obtain or reach God to supply your needs according to His riches in glory. In other words, it means refusing to give up or to let go. Seeking may be painful! To take pains means to hold firmly or steadfastly to a purpose despite obstacles, warnings or setbacks. Indeed, diligent seeking is a consistent, constant effort to accomplish whatever is undertaken. There is a tenacity that God is looking for in our search for Him and it requires the law of seeking Heb 11:6.Number Three: ‘Knock’- This is the beginning of confronting your confrontations. To knock is to affect your generation in a unique way by spiritual stubbornness. It is the ability to collide forces with forces, for when power meets with power, the lower power must bow to the higher power. It takes a knocking prayer to take hold of destiny by force. Matthew 11:12. God says you have to come to His house and knocking at one time and giving up and going home empty. You have to get to the point where you’re not ashamed anymore to stand at the door and keep knocking. You must insist that for God’s answer. Don’t give up. God will not answer you just because you are His child. He will answer you because of your shameless insistence, persistence and diligence Luke 11: 5-8.??Number Four. ‘Fasting’- This is the period of abstention or self-denial. It can be food or anything that you gain pleasure doing. It must be conducted in the atmosphere of doing business with God. Daniel 9:3. There are problems that won’t just go away until you enter into this realm 2 Chronicles 7:14, Mark 9:27-29, Esther 4:16, Luke 2:27. Fasting along with prayer seems to indicate the sincerity of the people praying and the critical nature of the situations in which they find themselves. Therefore, the more critical the situation is, the more appropriate the fasting and prayer. This is one of the reasons why this ministry believes in skipping your dinner to change your circumstances.Number Five. ‘Vowing to change your circumstances’ -To vow is a voluntary offering to God demanding that your life status be changed. And Jacob vowed a vow. Gen 28:20. It is giving an assignment to your offerings and sending it as dove to reach heaven. Many people come to us and promise God many things if he grants them a miracle, but few people came back to appreciate God and fulfill their vow. It is a sin and may lead to another curse if we vow to God and fail to fulfill it Deuteronomy 23:21-23, Numbers 30:2. A vow paid is a seed on assignment, Psalm 76:11. If you want to experience financial increase, learn to vow and also learn to fulfill your vow Psalm 61:8, Psalm 116:14-19.??Number Six. ‘Liquid Petition’ -Weeping prayer is powerful. It is an act of self-abandonment Psalm 30:5. When your enemies have mocked you, like they did to Hannah in 1 Samuel 1:15-20, when your situations have refused to answer the everyday Sunday school prayer. When it seems that defeat is eminent and there is no one to run to. This is the prayer that moves heaven to attend to your supplications. But to Hannah he gave a double portion because he loved her, and the LORD had closed her womb. Because the LORD had closed Hannah’s womb, her rival kept provoking her in order to irritate her” 1 Samuel 1: 5-6.Men and Brethren, every problem is a choice. Hannah had a choice to conclude that God was behind her problem, she had a choice to allow herself to be constantly mocked by her enemy. But the truth remains that only you can decide what your problems will do for you. Your problem can be your wings that will cause you to fly through the world. Your problem can cause God to step into your situation and cause miracles to happen; as it was in the case of Hannah. In this realm you are asking God, let my tears be my eloquence, let my tears be my oratory. Therefore, anytime the enemy provokes you to tears, you must use those tears as your weapon of warfare. Not of grumbling, but a way to say to God, let my tears be my words, let my tears speak for me. It takes humility to cry.?? Number Seven. ‘Wrestling with God’- This is the prayer of telling God, I will never let you go unless you bless me. Your name may have hunted your life. When you are desperate, you won’t need to be talked into fasting, praying or living in obedience. You just do it because there is no other option. When you get to this point in your life, rest assured that the Lord will show up in your situation. He will change your name. It does not matter how many years it will take, your mother may have given birth to you in pain, your territory may be in pain, it is you declaring that ‘I will hold on to Him. Telling God ‘you have to change my name to change my circumstances’; it is you telling God this is the final full stop of my stress and failure Genesis 32:22-28, 1 Chronicles 4:9-10.?? The truth is that we all need courage and discipline to face life. You can’t have a better life outside God. You can only have a better life by inspirational revelation of God. The secret of your life is based on what you do with the divine instructions you received from God.Afternoon ppl"
68857206,1,"1. Guys love to marry an Independent and Matured lady... So instead of sitting there and waiting to be bluffed by a guy, focus on getting a career that would take you out of the house wife category... 2. Never let the sweet talks of guys deceive you, most times they just want to go between your legs and run off thereafter. 3. Remove the mentality from your mind that guys will keep springing up to approach you. The older you get by the day, the less toasters you will have. 4. Playing 'too' hard to get is the worst thing you should ever start, remember, Nothing lasts forever. If you still doubt, check out the number of matured single ladies looking up to GOD FOR A MIRACLE. 5. Never extort things from a guy you don't love, guys always have ways of paying a girl back, either through their FRIENDS or total 'PAID' STRANGERS....BECAREFUL. 6. Never be deceived you can trap a guy through sex. A man will also return to his wife who sex starves him for years once he loves and trust her. You can never win a man over with your body. 7. If all you take to the relationship is the mind set to EXTRACT MONEY from him, don't complain if all he ask from you is your body. He has seen you have nothing else to offer... 8. Don't be fooled when Guys tell you they have never met a prettier girl, they will say that same thing to an80year old woman they want to get intimate with. 9. A guy always taking you to the SILVER-BIRD, FAST FOOD, MALL AND EVENTS AT MUSON CENTER /NATIONAL THEATRE is no sign that he loves you, if he doesn't care to ask and PLAN YOUR FUTURE TOGETHER then you are just his 'SOCIAL MATE' and nothing else.... 10. If the only time he invites you over is when he needs to cook, clean the house and do his laundry, then just know you are his ""executive house help"". 11. If he avoids meeting your family and close friends then it is an obvious sign he is just playing games with you. 12. Don't always change the tv station from NTV to CHANNEL O, MTV and Fashion TV. Take time to find out what is bothering him and how you can help out. 13. If the only places he doesn't frown when you enter are his bedroom and kitchen then know you aren't welcome (only being used). Have you noticed that most of the ladies that end up being emotionally abused are the ones at the receiving end...Always with open arms, requesting for something and ready to receive... The more you widen your arms, the more he widens your legs... A grown up guy who gives the excuse about his parents being wild when he brings female visitors to the house is a sign that HE HAS A SERIOUS GIRL AND HAS INTRODUCED HER TO HIS PARENTS ALREADY... ADVISE YOURSELF... FINALLY, I ALWAYS SAY THIS AND WILL REPEAT IT AGAIN... It's better to be sitting in a taxi smiling happily than to be in your husband’s fresh air conditioned BMW x6 with bruised eyes wearing a fresh Gucci shades alongside a Burberry scarf.... JUST REMEMBER!!! DATING A RICH MAN DOESN'T GUARANTEE HAPPINESS IN MARRIAGE... MONEY IS NOT EVERYTHING..... MAKING RIGHT CHOICES IN LIFE IS WHAT MATTERS MOST."

17105289,1,"Monday, February 10, 2014??St. Scholastica?(480-542?)??Twins often share the same interests and ideas with an equal intensity. Therefore, it is no surprise that Scholastica and her twin brother, Benedict (July 11), established religious communities within a few miles from each other.?Born in 480 of wealthy parents, Scholastica and Benedict were brought up together until he left central Italy for Rome to continue his studies.??Little is known of Scholastica’s early life. She founded a religious community for women near Monte Cassino at Plombariola, five miles from where her brother governed a monastery.??The twins visited each other once a year in a farmhouse because Scholastica was not permitted inside the monastery. They spent these times discussing spiritual matters.??According to the Dialogues of St. Gregory the Great, the brother and sister spent their last day together in prayer and conversation. Scholastica sensed her death was close at hand and she begged Benedict to stay with her until the next day.??He refused her request because he did not want to spend a night outside the monastery, thus breaking his own Rule. Scholastica asked God to let her brother remain and a severe thunderstorm broke out, preventing Benedict and his monks from returning to the abbey.??Benedict cried out, “God forgive you, Sister. What have you done?” Scholastica replied, “I asked a favor of you and you refused. I asked it of God and he granted it.”??Brother and sister parted the next morning after their long discussion. Three days later, Benedict was praying in his monastery and saw the soul of his sister rising heavenward in the form of a white dove. Benedict then announced the death of his sister to the monks and later buried her in the tomb he had prepared for himself.??Comment:??Scholastica and Benedict gave themselves totally to God and gave top priority to deepening their friendship with him through prayer. They sacrificed some of the opportunities they would have had to be together as brother and sister in order better to fulfill their vocation to the religious life. In coming closer to Christ, however, they found they were also closer to each other. In joining a religious community, they did not forget or forsake their family but rather found more brothers and sisters.??Quote:??“All religious are under an obligation, in accordance with the particular vocation of each, to work zealously and diligently for the building up and growth of the whole mystical body of Christ and for the good of the particular churches. It is their duty to foster these objectives primarily by means of prayer, works of penance, and by the example of their own lives” (Vatican II, Decree on the Pastoral Office of Bishops, 33, Austin Flannery translation).??Patron Saint of:??Nuns"

Orr has since apologized to the equally apologetic Smart, who's been suspended for three games.....Here comes His Nattyness, with his world class naivete, categorically opining that fans have no business verbally abusing the athletes they watch perform, especially without provocation.....The question dancing on his lips is this: What must be done to address FAN ABUSE? His Nattyness doesn't think it can be eradicated, since there isn't a cure for idiocy, but he strongly believes unruly, abusive fans must suffer some rehabilitative consequence for any untoward conduct!"

17109422,1,"First it says they will see the Son of man coming in his kingdom before they died. They did. The next chapter continues:??Matt 17:1 Now after six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John his brother, led them up on a high mountain by themselves.”??In Mark 9:1-10: And He said to them, “Assuredly, I say to you that there are some standing here who will not taste death till they see the kingdom of God present with power.” Now after six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John, and led them up on a high mountain apart by themselves; and He was transfigured before them.??Also Luke 9:27-37: “But I tell you truly, there are some standing here who shall not taste death till they see the kingdom of God.” Now it came to pass, about eight days after these sayings, that He took Peter, John, and James and went up on the mountain to pray”.??So how did they see this? They saw the glory of His kingdom on the Mt. of Transfiguration. Two accounts Matthew and Mark say 6 day's, but Luke says 8 day's. Jesus often spoke of something that was important more than once- that is why we have recorded 8 days and also 6 days for the same event, he said it more than once.??Mk.9:2 “He was transfigured before them- the light came from within him not from without showing the glory that was hidden from them since his birth. This is why Jesus is called “the brightness of His glory and the express image of His person” (Heb 1:3) he forever is “the Lord of glory” (1 Cor .2:8). When John sees Jesus in heaven he is enthroned, and seen in his glory revealed. Rev 1:16 “His countenance was like the sun shining in its strength.??While Jesus is PRAYING he is transfigured; and Moses and Elijah both appear in glory (Lk.9). Matthew states Jesus’ face shone like the sun, and His clothes became as white as the light, Mark reports He was transfigured that his clothes became shining, exceedingly white, like snow, such as no launderer on earth can whiten them . Luke says the appearance of His face was altered, and His robe became white and glistening. His glory showed through his human nature, even his clothes.??Mt.17 “While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them; and suddenly a voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Hear Him!” If they were not there for his baptism when God spoke from heaven and the Spirit came upon him like a dove, they were here experiencing something more spectacular. Just as a cloud covered the mountain and the glory of the LORD rested on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days (Exod. 24:15-18) Moses once again is on a Mountain engulfed in the cloud and hearing God’s voice from heaven. This too is called a holy mountain by Peter.??The presence of Moses and Elijah are associated with the kingdom, they were expected by the Jewish people to return at the end of the age with the Messiah. This is why Peter wanted to build them tabernacles. He thought the kingdom had arrived with their being present and seeing Jesus glorified.??The three closest disciples were given a preview of what it would be like in the kingdom, this is how Peter describes it in 2 Pt. 1:16-18 “ For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming (parousia) of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty. For he received from God the Father honor and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. And we heard this voice which came from heaven when we were with him on the Holy mountain.”??Jesus said previously, some would not die until they see the coming of the kingdom in power.” They did even though it was temporary.<br /><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10202445286126905&set=gm.594273707319072&type=1&relevant_count=1""></a><br />"

The link goes to a design which is of a Dove and Roses which are both linked closely to Aphrodite and Venus.  The Artfire shop is only in dollars at present, however, if you visit the Fan page I have most of the prices up there in £ although I haven't added the postage as that will, of course, differ according to what you're buying, how many items and the weight. I always send items via First Class post unless you contact and wish to discuss an alternative method. :) Everything is embroidered entirely by hand and the bags are all fully lined which makes them sturdier imho.. :) I've been involved in Craft (Pagan) for about 20 years now and have had an interest in mythology and related subjects since my early teens (over 40 now so it's ages! lol) ..

17101106,1,"Our Link with Heaven??And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Matthew 3:17.?? ??After Christ was baptized of John in Jordan, He came up out of the water, and bowing upon the banks of the river He prayed with fervency to His heavenly Father for strength to endure the conflict with the prince of darkness in which He was about to engage. The heavens were opened to His prayer, and the light of God’s glory, brighter than the sun at noonday, came from the throne of the Eternal, and assuming the form of a dove with the appearance of burnished gold, encircled the Son of God, while the clear voice from the excellent glory was heard in terrible majesty, saying, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”?? ??Here was the assurance to the Son of God that His Father accepted the fallen race through their representative and that He had granted them a second trial. The communication between heaven and earth, between God and man, which had been broken by the fall of Adam, was resumed. He who knew no sin became sin for the race, that His righteousness might be imputed to man. Through the perfection of Christ’s character, man was elevated in the scale of moral value with God; and through the merits of Christ, finite man was linked to the Infinite. Thus the gulf which sin had made was bridged by the world’s Redeemer.?? ??But few have a true sense of the great privileges which Christ gained for man by thus opening heaven before him. The Son of God was then the representative of our race; and the special power and glory which the Majesty of heaven conferred upon Him, and His words of approval, are the surest pledge of His love and good will to man. As Christ’s intercessions in our behalf were heard, the evidence was given to man that God will accept our prayers in our own behalf through the name of Jesus. The continued, earnest prayer of faith will bring us light and strength to withstand the fiercest assaults of Satan.... The life of a living Christian is a life of living prayer.... Our great Leader points us to the open heavens as the only source of light and strength."

17109159,1,"Sermon from February 9th 2014 Chesley Community Church?“The Servant”?Text:  Isaiah 42:1-4?? In our study of the Book of Isaiah we are examining how the Word of God spoke to the people of Isaiah’s day and how God continues to speak to us today. Isaiah declared the Word of God and we know what we are reading is still true?Last week I tried to encourage you to take time to read your Bible.?Did you read from your Bible this week?   I hope so.??Did you know that the book of Isaiah is structured like the Bible?? Just like the Bible’s 66 books, Isaiah has 66 chapters.?There are 39 chapters in Isaiah that deal with the history of the Israel and the Old Testament history of Israel also has 39 books.? Isaiah has 27 chapters dealing with dealing with the future of the Israelite people, many dealing prophecy and the coming Messiah.?The New Testament has 27 books dealing with the life of Jesus Christ and the future of Christians.??This morning in Isaiah 42 we are looking at what has been called one of the ""Servant Songs"". Jesus read this same scripture and we know he knew it well because it spoke of his life and ministry.?Prayer?READ Isaiah 42:1-9 – only going to get to the first verses today??1. Who is the SERVANT??Who is this one mentioned in our text?  I believe it is Jesus.? “My servant whom I uphold”  ? “My chosen in whom I delight” ?Matthew 3:16, 17 “As soon as Jesus was baptised, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him. 17 And a voice from heaven said, ‘This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.’?v.1 “I will put my Spirit on him” ?Matthew 3:16 ? “the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him”.??v. 2 “He will not shout or cry out, or raise his voice in the streets.”?Matthew 12:15-18  “Aware of this, Jesus withdrew from that place. A large crowd followed him, and he healed all who were ill. 16 He warned them not to tell others about him. 17 This was to fulfil what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah:?‘Here is my servant whom I have chosen, the one I love, in whom I delight; I will put my Spirit on him, and he will proclaim justice to the nations’.”??Isaiah introduces us to the Servant of God, Jesus Christ.  He is called a “servant” because he came to do the Father’s will, in the God the Father’s way. Jesus did not act in his own power and authority; but in all ways, during his lifetime, Jesus submitted to the leading of God the Father.? More than 750 years would pass and then another prophet, John the Baptist, would baptise the One greater than himself.  John was humbled by the holiness of Jesus and he would hear the voice of God, ?""This is My Son...Whom I love...with Him I am well pleased."" Mt. 3:17??From that time on Jesus began to fulfill the prophecy of Isaiah.??2. What will the SERVANT be like? ? How does Isaiah describe the one we know as Jesus?? V.2  “He will not shout or cry out, or raise his voice in the streets.?v.3 A bruised reed he will not break, and a smouldering wick he will not snuff out.  In faithfulness he will bring forth justice; he will not falter or be discouraged till he establishes justice on earth.”? Jesus would quietly go about his work as he followed God’s leading.  God the Father had a plan and it required the obedience of His Son. ?Jesus did many miracles and yet he was not arrogant or conceited.  ? Though he was the greatest man to ever live, Jesus associated with the poor and the lowly. He met their needs like a servant.  Taking a towel and basin he even washed the feet of his disciples. The teacher took the role of a slave, to show how we must love one another in God’s plan.  As Matthew wrote 12:16 “He (Jesus) warned them not to tell others about him.”?  Matthew knew our text, Isaiah 42 and we can read it in 12:18-21.?This is the longest quote from the Old Testament in the New Testament.??2. What will the SERVANT be like?? How does Isaiah describe the one we know as Jesus?? In a word – Gentle?Gentleness does not mean weakness. It does not mean that the one who is gentle is fragile or in any way ineffective. ? Gentleness is a tough football player holding his newborn daughter.? Jesus was gentle and he was not weak. His strength was tender.?We humans are really not that strong. We are weak.?Winter weather can humble us and all our plans, so can a tiny flu virus.?We can even be devastated by an unkind word and hurt when we are not loved.?Let’s face it, we live in a world of “bruised reeds” and “smoldering wicks”.?Aren’t you glad that it was said of Jesus:  ""A bruised reed He will not break, and a smoldering wick He will not snuff out.""???In the lands of Israel people were familiar with reeds along the banks of the Jordan River. We have water loving plants with hollow stems too.? I can remember trying to find hollow reeds as a boy. We would find plants with hollow stems and break them off and see if you could blow through them. If you could blow through them you could make a kind of mini peashooter. Then one day some older boys showed me how to set the end on fire and smoke them. They were supposed to be like the cigarettes our parents smoked; except fire would get in your mouth if they were too short!? It doesn’t take much effort to break a reed. If you look at a patch of reeds along a riverbank, many of them will already be broken over, perhaps by the wind or animals.?Once a reed is bent over it can’t be straightened up again.  ?It will just fall over in the same place, again and again. ? In our text, Isaiah isn’t really that interested in water plants.  He is giving an object lesson dealing with people. We are not really very strong.  When we are hurt in one place it seems we get hurt in that same place over and over again.  Remember having a sore finger? You always hit it again!??We try to be strong.  We try to hold ourselves up on our own; but, we fail. ?Like reeds, we can get hurt, knocked down, bruised and we often carry the evidence of the bad things that have happened to our bodies.?? Many people who once stood tall have been hurt. Some suffered loss and past discouragements have taught them to “keep their head down”.  ?Some people are permanently bent over by the hard life they live, tough jobs, thankless work, old injuries or addiction to alcohol and drugs.? Some people look strong; but inside they do not feel healthy inside.?They may be suffering from an accidental injury or a debilitating disease.  We never know just by looking at someone; but, from headaches to hurt toes; the smiling people you meet, may be hurting.?Broken, bruised and hurting people are all around us.??Jesus came to help and to heal the broken people of this world.?Some people received miracles.  They were bent over like broken reeds but Jesus healed them and miraculously they stood tall again.  Even though all the power we could ever imagine was present in just his word, Jesus did not break the little strength remaining to the people he helped.  He was gentle and he supported people. Jesus made the lame walk and the crippled man stood tall.? It amazes me why some people seem to be afraid of Jesus. ? What did Jesus ever do to deserve people taking his name in vain?? What is it that terrifies some people??Why do they hear condemnation rather than the gentle call of the Lord??How can the healing gentleness of the Savour be harmful?? Jesus is still concerned with our hurts habits and hang-ups today.?But it is not his judgement we face.  Instead we find his grace. We find an opportunity for a new start in life, a second or even a ninety-second chance. Jesus gives us hope and courage to face tomorrow.  He is the friend that never abandons us. ?He is the doctor that treats our real sickness.?He is our comforter in distress and Jesus is the lifter of our head.? Jesus was not repulsed by the lepers.  They were diseased.  They were unclean.  They were untouchable beggars, dying a slow terrible death. But Jesus spoke to them, touched them and their brokenness was healed.? The demon-possessed man was also a cast off of society.  He was a tormented soul, living among tombs of the dead. He was feared by all. Living in one body was both uncontrollable rage and frightening loneliness. ? But Jesus healed him.?Jesus came and the man received deliverance and a new life. ?Jesus still changes lives today! Has Jesus made a difference in your life??My encounter with Jesus resulted in a new life for me too!? In Isaiah`s day, oil lamps provided light for their homes. Oil lamps are not very bright compared to the abundant light we enjoy in our homes today. But, when it is really dark, any light is better than no light. ?Oil lamps require oil, a wick and fire. If the oil runs out, the wick begins to smolder.  Unless fresh oil is poured into the lamp the smouldering wick will go out.? Like the “broken reeds”, the “smouldering wick” represents people too.  We might say they are “out of gas” or “burnt out”. They started well. Things were going fine; but, they ran out of fuel. ? Men, let me ask you, do you let the gas gauge get closer to empty than your wife appreciates?  I confess that is the way it is with our car. ? I remember heading home one Sunday night and I planned to get gas on the way.  I had enough gas to get to the station but we stayed to long visiting friends and the gas station was closed when we passed it. It wasn’t long before the gas light came on and we still had a long way to go. I`m sure we came the last few miles on fumes. Now I try to get gas before it’s empty!? People probably don’t intend to run out of gas, spiritually. They just get busy or they forget that they need to regularly refuel and refocus their souls. Perhaps it was a long time since they attended church, or read their Bibles, or prayed.? Suddenly, when they need the light, it is not there. Their relationship with the Lord was once a highlight in their life; but now, God seems far away and their faith is faint and flickering and almost gone and it is getting dark.? Isaiah says that the “servant” will not snuff out the last hope of light.?Instead there will be new oil, new power, new hope for the dark times of life. ?Our spiritual fire is not dependent on our own oil reserves.  It is dependent upon the provision of the Lord who gives “us this day, our daily bread”.?We are not designed to run without regular spiritual maintenance. ? Jesus helps us burn brightly. ?Jesus came, as John the Baptist said, “to baptise us with the Holy Spirit and with fire.”?Maybe you are here this morning and you feel like you are a broken reed.? You need healing and a fresh start.?Maybe you feel as if your spiritual fire has gone out. ? You know it has been a long time since you felt spiritually full and on fire for the Lord.?Today is the day. Today is the best day to come to Jesus and now is the best time to pray.??3.  What will the SERVANT do?? ?3,4 “In faithfulness he will bring forth justice; 4 he will not falter or be discouraged till he establishes justice on earth. In his law the islands will put their hope.""?Is there justice on earth?  Yes, somewhat; but certainly not always.?True justice is not found in politics, or power or personalities. ?True justice is not served with law or legislation or litigation.? Justice will not be found until we value the least of the world’s poor as much as we respect the wealthy, the famous and the beautiful.?I think the reign and rule of Jesus Christ is the only hope for this world.? Only Jesus can bring true justice. ? Only he knows what is true and just and right.?Jesus will not falter, or stop, or be discouraged, until His justice is established.?We know the Lord’s plan for justice on this earth. ?It is found in the prayer he taught his disciples to pray to God the Father: “Thy kingdom come.  Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.”?We will never get our lives right, unless we put God first.?There will be no justice, until we love God and love our neighbour as we love ourselves. ?? Isaiah said it.? Jesus lives it.? I believe it. Jesus loves you!"

17110641,1,"Monday, February 10?MEMORIAL OF SCHOLASTICA, VIRGIN, RELIGIOUS? ?Make every visitation sacred?Once a year Saint Scholastica and her equally busy brother, Saint Benedict, would pause to visit each other for a day. At one of these meetings Scholastica wanted Benedict to linger on but he insisted on going. Tradition has it that Scholastica prayed that God hear the request her brother was ignoring, and a furious storm came up, forcing him to stay longer. Back home three days later, Benedict saw his sister’s soul leaving the earth and ascending to heaven in the form of a shining white dove. Cherish each visit with a loved one as if it were your last.??TODAY’S READINGS: 1 Kings 8:1-7, 9-13; Mark 6:53-56 ?“They . . . began to bring in the sick on mats to wherever they heard he was.”??©2014, TrueQuest Communications, LLC, TrueQuest.biz"

68857208,1,"1. Guys love to marry an Independent and Matured lady... So instead of sitting there and waiting to be bluffed by a guy, focus on getting a career that would take you out of the house wife category... 2. Never let the sweet talks of guys deceive you, most times they just want to go between your legs and run off thereafter. 3. Remove the mentality from your mind that guys will keep springing up to approach you. The older you get by the day, the less toasters you will have. 4. Playing 'too' hard to get is the worst thing you should ever start, remember, Nothing lasts forever. If you still doubt, check out the number of matured single ladies looking up to GOD FOR A MIRACLE. 5. Never extort things from a guy you don't love, guys always have ways of paying a girl back, either through their FRIENDS or total 'PAID' STRANGERS....BECAREFUL. 6. Never be deceived you can trap a guy through sex. A man will also return to his wife who sex starves him for years once he loves and trust her. You can never win a man over with your body . 7. If all you take to the relationship is the mind set to EXTRACT MONEY from him, don't complain if all he ask from you is your body. He has seen you have nothing else to offer... 8. Don't be fooled when Guys tell you they have never met a prettier girl, they will say that same thing to an80year old woman they want to get intimate with. 9. A guy always taking you to the SILVER-BIRD, FAST FOOD, MALL AND EVENTS AT MUSON CENTER /NATIONAL THEATRE is no sign that he loves you, if he doesn't care to ask and PLAN YOUR FUTURE TOGETHER then you are just his 'SOCIAL MATE' and nothing else.... 10. If the only time he invites you over is when he needs to cook, clean the house and do his laundry, then just know you are his ""executive house help"". 11. If he avoids meeting your family and close friends then it is an obvious sign he is just playing games with you. 12. Don't always change the tv station from NTV to CHANNEL O, MTV and Fashion TV. Take time to find out what is bothering him and how you can help out. 13. If the only places he doesn't frown when you enter are his bedroom and kitchen then know you aren't welcome (only being used). Have you noticed that most of the ladies that end up being emotionally abused are the ones at the receiving end...Always with open arms, requesting for something and ready to receive... The more you widen your arms, the more he widens your legs... A grown up guy who gives the excuse about his parents being wild when he brings female visitors to the house is a sign that HE HAS A SERIOUS GIRL AND HAS INTRODUCED HER TO HIS PARENTS ALREADY... ADVISE YOURSELF... FINALLY, I ALWAYS SAY THIS AND WILL REPEAT IT AGAIN... It's better to be sitting in a taxi smiling happily than to be in your husband’s fresh air conditioned BMW x6 with bruised eyes wearing a fresh Gucci shades alongside a Burberry scarf.... JUST REMEMBER!!! DATING A RICH MAN DOESN'T GUARANTEE HAPPINESS IN MARRIAGE... MONEY IS NOT EVERYTHING.....MAKING RIGHT CHOICES IN LIFE IS WHAT MATTERS MOST."
